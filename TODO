Things needed to be done
========================

0 [DONE] ) Repeat Tests on Code rather than comments

1) Map feature vectors back to file somehow so that predictions file and results are more meaningful

2) Remove some of the less useful features, will this theoretically improve anything?

3) Figure out a way to create feature vectors using "@param" etc., multiple SVMs?

4) Overall system?, how to know what is correct/incorrect?
