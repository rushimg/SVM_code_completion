Things needed to be done
========================

[DONE] ) Repeat Tests on Code rather than comments

[DONE] ) Map feature vectors back to file somehow so that predictions file and results are more meaningful

1) BUG!! : why does adding new testing data change the predicted values? tfidf values are differnt for tests

* right now trying to figure out why the test and the train idfs are differnt for the same strings 

* transductive SVM where some of the training labels can be zero and the SVM will classsify them. 

2) Rgs basecase Example

3) How is this system learning, how to know what is correct/incorrect?

4) To try, +feature selection +@parmas

4) Overall system?, how to know what is correct/incorrect?
