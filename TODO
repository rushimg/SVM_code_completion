Things needed to be done
========================

[DONE] ) Repeat Tests on Code rather than comments

[DONE] ) Map feature vectors back to file somehow so that predictions file and results are more meaningful

1) [DONE] BUG!! : why does adding new testing data change the predicted values? tfidf values are differnt for tests
* right now trying to figure out why the test and the train idfs are differnt for the same strings 
* transductive SVM where some of the training labels can be zero and the SVM will classsify them. 
** Should the tfidfs be cacl'd against the train, test or both data sets **

2) [fri] Rgs basecase Example

3) [fri] How is this system learning, how to know what is correct/incorrect?

4) [nw] To try, +feature selection +@parmas

5) [wat] Overall system?, how to know what is correct/incorrect?
	- how to know and learn what is correct incorrect?
	- how to link up with java system?
	- what data from the plugin to use?
	- what is the corpus? The downloaded API? Web docs?
