/**
 * Base class providing common services for renderers.  Most methods that update
 * attributes of the renderer will fire a {@link RendererChangeEvent}, which
 * normally means the plot that owns the renderer will receive notification that
 * the renderer has been changed (the plot will, in turn, notify the chart).
