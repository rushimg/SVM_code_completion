/**
 * The interface that must be supported by classes that wish to receive
 * notification of changes to an axis.
 * <P>
 * The Plot class implements this interface, and automatically registers with
 * its axes (if any). Any axis changes are passed on by the plot as a plot
 * change event.  This is part of the notification mechanism that ensures that
 * charts are redrawn whenever changes are made to any chart component.
