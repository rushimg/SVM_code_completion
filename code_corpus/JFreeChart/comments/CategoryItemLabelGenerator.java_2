/**
 * A <i>category item label generator</i> is an object that can be assigned to a
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.renderer.category.CategoryItemRenderer} and that
 * assumes responsibility for creating text items to be used as labels for the
 * items in a {@link org.jfree.chart.plot.CategoryPlot}.
 * <p>
 * To assist with cloning charts, classes that implement this interface should
 * also implement the {@link org.jfree.util.PublicCloneable} interface.
