    /**
     * Adds a marker for display (in the foreground) against the domain axis and
     * sends a {@link PlotChangeEvent} to all registered listeners. Typically a
     * marker will be drawn by the renderer as a line perpendicular to the
     * domain axis, however this is entirely up to the renderer.
     *
     * @param marker  the marker (<code>null</code> not permitted).
     *
