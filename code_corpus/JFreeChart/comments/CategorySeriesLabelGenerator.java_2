/**
 * A generator that creates labels for the series in a {@link CategoryDataset}.
 * <P>
 * Classes that implement this interface should be either (a) immutable, or
 * (b) cloneable via the <code>PublicCloneable</code> interface (defined in
 * the JCommon class library).  This provides a mechanism for the referring
 * renderer to clone the generator if necessary.
