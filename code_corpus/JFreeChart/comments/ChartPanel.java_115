    /**
     * Draws zoom rectangle (if present).
     * The drawing is performed in XOR mode, therefore
     * when this method is called twice in a row,
     * the second call will completely restore the state
     * of the canvas.
     *
     * @param g2 the graphics device.
     * @param xor  use XOR for drawing?
