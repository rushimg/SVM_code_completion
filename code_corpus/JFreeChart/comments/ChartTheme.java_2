/**
 * A {@link ChartTheme} a class that can apply a style or 'theme' to a chart.
 * It can be implemented in an arbitrary manner, with the styling applied to
 * the chart via the <code>apply(JFreeChart)</code> method.  We provide one
 * implementation ({@link StandardChartTheme}) that just mimics the manual
 * process of calling methods to set various chart parameters.
 *
 * @since 1.0.11
