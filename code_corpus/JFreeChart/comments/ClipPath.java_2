/**
 * This class would typically be used with a
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.plot.ContourPlot}.  It allows the user to define a
 * <code>GeneralPath</code> curve in plot coordinates.  This curve can then be
 * used mask off or define regions within the contour plot.  The data must be
 * sorted.
 *
 * @deprecated This class is no longer supported (as of version 1.0.4).  If
 *     you are creating contour plots, please try to use {@link XYPlot} and
 *     {@link XYBlockRenderer}.
