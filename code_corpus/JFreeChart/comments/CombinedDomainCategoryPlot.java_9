    /**
     * Removes a subplot from the combined chart.  Potentially, this removes
     * some unique categories from the overall union of the datasets...so the
     * domain axis is reconfigured, then a {@link PlotChangeEvent} is sent to
     * all registered listeners.
     *
     * @param subplot  the subplot (<code>null</code> not permitted).
