    /**
     * Defines dataArea rectangle as the ratio formed from dividing height by
     * width (of the dataArea).  Modifies plot area calculations.
     * ratio>0 will attempt to layout the plot so that the
     * dataArea.height/dataArea.width = ratio.
     * ratio<0 will attempt to layout the plot so that the
     * dataArea.height/dataArea.width in plot units (not java2D units as when
     * ratio>0) = -1.*ratio.
