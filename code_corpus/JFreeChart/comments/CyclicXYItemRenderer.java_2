/**
 * The Cyclic XY item renderer is specially designed to handle cyclic axis.
 * While the standard renderer would draw a line across the plot when a cycling
 * occurs, the cyclic renderer splits the line at each cycle end instead. This
 * is done by interpolating new points at cycle boundary. Thus, correct
 * appearance is restored.
 *
 * The Cyclic XY item renderer works exactly like a standard XY item renderer
 * with non-cyclic axis.
