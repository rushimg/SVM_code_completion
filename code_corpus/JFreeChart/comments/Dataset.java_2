/**
 * The base interface for data sets.
 * <P>
 * All datasets are required to support the {@link DatasetChangeEvent}
 * mechanism by allowing listeners to register and receive notification of any
 * changes to the dataset.
 * <P>
 * In addition, all datasets must belong to one (and only one)
 * {@link DatasetGroup}.  The group object maintains a reader-writer lock
 * which provides synchronised access to the datasets in multi-threaded code.
