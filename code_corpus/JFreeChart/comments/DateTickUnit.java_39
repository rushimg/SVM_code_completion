    /**
     * Returns the roll unit.  This is the amount by which the tick advances if
     * it is "hidden" when displayed on a segmented date axis.  Typically the
     * roll will be smaller than the regular tick unit (for example, a 7 day
     * tick unit might use a 1 day roll).
     *
     * @return The roll unit.
     *
     * @deprecated As of version 1.0.13, use {@link #getRollUnitType()}.
