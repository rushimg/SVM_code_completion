    /**
     * Returns the day as a {@link SerialDate}.  Note: the reference that is
     * returned should be an instance of an immutable {@link SerialDate}
     * (otherwise the caller could use the reference to alter the state of
     * this <code>Day</code> instance, and <code>Day</code> is supposed
     * to be immutable).
