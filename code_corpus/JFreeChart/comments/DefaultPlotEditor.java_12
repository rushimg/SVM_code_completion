    /**
     * Standard constructor - constructs a panel for editing the properties of
     * the specified plot.
     * <P>
     * In designing the panel, we need to be aware that subclasses of Plot will
     * need to implement subclasses of PlotPropertyEditPanel - so we need to
     * leave one or two 'slots' where the subclasses can extend the user
     * interface.
     *
     * @param plot  the plot, which should be changed.
