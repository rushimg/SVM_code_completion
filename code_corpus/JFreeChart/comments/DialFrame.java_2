/**
 * A dial frame is the face plate for a dial plot - it is always drawn last.
 * JFreeChart includes a couple of implementations of this interface
 * ({@link StandardDialFrame} and {@link ArcDialFrame}).
 * <br><br>
 * Classes that implement this interface should be {@link Serializable},
 * otherwise chart serialization may fail.
