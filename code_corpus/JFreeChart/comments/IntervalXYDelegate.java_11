     * Sets the flag that indicates whether the interval width is automatically
     * calculated.  If the flag is set to <code>true</code>, the interval is
     * recalculated.
     * <p>
     * Note: recalculating the interval amounts to changing the data values
     * represented by the dataset.  The calling dataset must fire an
     * appropriate {@link DatasetChangeEvent}.
