     * Sets the fixed interval width and, as a side effect, sets the
     * <code>autoWidth</code> flag to <code>false</code>.
     * <br><br>
     * Note that changing the interval width amounts to changing the data
     * values represented by the dataset.  Therefore, the dataset
     * that is using this delegate is responsible for generating the
     * appropriate {@link DatasetChangeEvent}.
     *
     * @param w  the width (negative values not permitted).
