    /**
     * Tests the delegate for equality with an arbitrary object.  The
     * equality test considers two delegates to be equal if they would
     * calculate the same intervals for any given dataset (for this reason, the
     * dataset itself is NOT included in the equality test, because it is just
     * a reference back to the current 'owner' of the delegate).
     *
     * @param obj  the object (<code>null</code> permitted).
     *
     * @return A boolean.
