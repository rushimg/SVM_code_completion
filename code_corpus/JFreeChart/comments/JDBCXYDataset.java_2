/**
 * This class provides an {@link XYDataset} implementation over a database
 * JDBC result set.  The dataset is populated via a call to executeQuery with
 * the string sql query.  The sql query must return at least two columns.
 * The first column will be the x-axis and remaining columns y-axis values.
 * executeQuery can be called a number of times.
 *
 * The database connection is read-only and no write back facility exists.
