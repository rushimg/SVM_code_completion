    /**
     * Returns the main chart title.  Very often a chart will have just one
     * title, so we make this case simple by providing accessor methods for
     * the main title.  However, multiple titles are supported - see the
     * {@link #addSubtitle(Title)} method.
     *
     * @return The chart title (possibly <code>null</code>).
     *
     * @see #setTitle(TextTitle)
