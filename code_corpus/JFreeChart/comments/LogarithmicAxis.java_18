    /**
     * Returns the log10 value, depending on if values between 0 and
     * 1 are being plotted.  If negative values are not allowed and
     * the lower bound is between 0 and 10 then a normal log is
     * returned; otherwise the returned value is adjusted if the
     * given value is less than 10.
     *
     * @param val the value.
     *
     * @return log<sub>10</sub>(val).
