     * Returns a power of 10, depending on if values between 0 and
     * 1 are being plotted.  If negative values are not allowed and
     * the lower bound is between 0 and 10 then a normal power is
     * returned; otherwise the returned value is adjusted if the
     * given value is less than 1.
