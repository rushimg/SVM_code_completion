/**
 * An abstract class representing a unit of time.  Convenient methods are
 * provided for calculating the next and previous time periods.  Conversion
 * methods are defined that return the first and last milliseconds of the time
 * period.  The results from these methods are timezone dependent.
 * <P>
 * This class is immutable, and all subclasses should be immutable also.
