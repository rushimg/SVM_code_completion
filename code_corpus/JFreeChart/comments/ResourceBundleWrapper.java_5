    /**
     * Instantiate a {@link URLClassLoader} for resource lookups where the
     * codeBase URL is removed.  This method is typically called from an
     * applet's init() method.  If this method is never called, the
     * <code>getBundle()</code> methods map to the standard
     * {@link ResourceBundle} lookup methods.
     *
     * @param codeBase  the codeBase URL.
     * @param urlClassLoader  the class loader.
