     * Utility TimeZone object that has no DST and an offset equal to the
     * default TimeZone. This allows easy arithmetic between days as each one
     * will have equal size.
     *
     * @deprecated As of 1.0.7.  This field is initialised based on the
     *         default time zone, and doesn't take into account subsequent
     *         changes to the default.
