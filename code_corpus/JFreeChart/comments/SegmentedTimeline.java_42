    /**
     * Adds a segment as an exception. An exception segment is defined as a
     * segment to exclude from what would otherwise be considered a valid
     * segment of the timeline.  An exception segment can not be contained
     * inside an already excluded segment.  This is verified inside this
     * method, and if so, no action will occur (the proposed exception segment
     * will be discarded).
     *
     * @param segment  the segment to exclude.
