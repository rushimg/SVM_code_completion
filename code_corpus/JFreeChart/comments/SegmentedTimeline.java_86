    /**
     * Private internal class to represent a range of segments. This class is
     * mainly used to store in one object a range of exception segments. This
     * optimizes certain timelines that use a small segment size (like an
     * intraday timeline) allowing them to express a day exception as one
     * SegmentRange instead of multi Segments.
