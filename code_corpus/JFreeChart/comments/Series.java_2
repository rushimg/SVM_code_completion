/**
 * Base class representing a data series.  Subclasses are left to implement the
 * actual data structures.
 * <P>
 * The series has two properties ("Key" and "Description") for which you can
 * register a <code>PropertyChangeListener</code>.
 * <P>
 * You can also register a {@link SeriesChangeListener} to receive notification
 * of changes to the series data.
