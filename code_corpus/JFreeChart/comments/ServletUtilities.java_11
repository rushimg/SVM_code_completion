    /**
     * Creates the temporary directory if it does not exist.  Throws a
     * <code>RuntimeException</code> if the temporary directory is
     * <code>null</code>.  Uses the system property <code>java.io.tmpdir</code>
     * as the temporary directory.  This sounds like a strange thing to do but
     * my temporary directory was not created on my default Tomcat 4.0.3
     * installation.  Could save some questions on the forum if it is created
     * when not present.
