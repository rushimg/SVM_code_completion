    /**
     * Returns the value to be plotted at the interseries of the
     * series and the category.  This allows us to plot
     * <code>BY_ROW</code> or <code>BY_COLUMN</code> which basically is just
     * reversing the definition of the categories and data series being
     * plotted.
     *
     * @param series the series to be plotted.
     * @param cat the category within the series to be plotted.
     *
     * @return The value to be plotted (possibly <code>null</code>).
