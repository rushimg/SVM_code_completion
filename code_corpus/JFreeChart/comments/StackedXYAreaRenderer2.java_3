    /**
     * This flag controls whether or not the x-coordinates (in Java2D space)
     * are rounded to integers.  When set to true, this can avoid the vertical
     * striping that anti-aliasing can generate.  However, the rounding may not
     * be appropriate for output in high resolution formats (for example,
     * vector graphics formats such as SVG and PDF).
