/**
 * Standard item renderer for an {@link XYPlot}.  This class can draw (a)
 * shapes at each point, or (b) lines between points, or (c) both shapes and
 * lines.
 * <P>
 * This renderer has been retained for historical reasons and, in general, you
 * should use the {@link XYLineAndShapeRenderer} class instead.
