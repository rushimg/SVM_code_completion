/**
 * A dataset containing one or more data series containing (x, y) data items,
 * where all series in the dataset share the same set of x-values.  This is a
 * restricted form of the {@link XYDataset} interface (which allows independent
 * x-values between series). This is used primarily by the
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.renderer.xy.StackedXYAreaRenderer}.
