/**
 * Base class representing a tick unit.  This determines the spacing of the
 * tick marks on an axis.
 * <P>
 * This class (and any subclasses) should be immutable, the reason being that
 * ORDERED collections of tick units are maintained and if one instance can be
 * changed, it may destroy the order of the collection that it belongs to.
 * In addition, if the implementations are immutable, they can belong to
 * multiple collections.
