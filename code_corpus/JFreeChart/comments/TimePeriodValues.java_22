    /**
     * Returns a clone of the collection.
     * <P>
     * Notes:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>no need to clone the domain and range descriptions, since String 
     *       object is immutable;</li>
     *   <li>we pass over to the more general method createCopy(start, end).
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return A clone of the time series.
     * 
     * @throws CloneNotSupportedException if there is a cloning problem.
