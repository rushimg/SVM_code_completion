    /**
     * Sets a flag that controls whether the domain is treated as 'points in
     * time', or time periods.
     *
     * @param flag  the flag.
     *
     * @deprecated This flag is no longer used, as of 1.0.1.  The
     *             <code>includeInterval</code> flag in methods such as
     *             {@link #getDomainBounds(boolean)} makes this unnecessary.
