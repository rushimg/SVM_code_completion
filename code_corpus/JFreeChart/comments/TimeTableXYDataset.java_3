     * The data structure to store the values.  Each column represents
     * a series (elsewhere in JFreeChart rows are typically used for series,
     * but it doesn't matter that much since this data structure is private
     * and symmetrical anyway), each row contains values for the same
     * {@link RegularTimePeriod} (the rows are sorted into ascending order).
