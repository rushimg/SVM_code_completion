    /**
     * Returns a flag that controls whether the domain is treated as 'points in
     * time'.
     * <P>
     * This flag is used when determining the max and min values for the domain.
     * If true, then only the x-values are considered for the max and min
     * values.  If false, then the start and end x-values will also be taken
     * into consideration.
     *
     * @return The flag.
