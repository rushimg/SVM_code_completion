    /**
     * Sets the upper margin for the axis (as a percentage of the axis range)
     * and sends an {@link AxisChangeEvent} to all registered listeners.  This
     * margin is added only when the axis range is auto-calculated - if you set
     * the axis range manually, the margin is ignored.
     *
     * @param margin  the margin percentage (for example, 0.05 is five percent).
