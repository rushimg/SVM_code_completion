/**
 * A calendar week.  All years are considered to have 53 weeks, numbered from 1
 * to 53, although in many cases the 53rd week is empty.  Most of the time, the
 * 1st week of the year *begins* in the previous calendar year, but it always
 * finishes in the current year (this behaviour matches the workings of the
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code> class).
 * <P>
 * This class is immutable, which is a requirement for all
 * {@link RegularTimePeriod} subclasses.
