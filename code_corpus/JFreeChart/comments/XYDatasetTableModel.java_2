/**
 * A READ-ONLY wrapper around a {@link TableXYDataset} to convert it to a
 * table model for use in a JTable.  The first column of the table shows the
 * x-values, the remaining columns show the y-values for each series (series 0
 * appears in column 1, series 1 appears in column 2, etc).
 * <P>
 * TO DO:
 * <ul>
 * <li>implement proper naming for x axis (getColumnName)</li>
 * <li>implement setValueAt to remove READ-ONLY constraint (not sure how)</li>
 * </ul>
