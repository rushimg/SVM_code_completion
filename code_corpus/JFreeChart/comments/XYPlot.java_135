    /**
     * Adds a marker for the domain axis and sends a {@link PlotChangeEvent}
     * to all registered listeners.
     * <P>
     * Typically a marker will be drawn by the renderer as a line perpendicular
     * to the range axis, however this is entirely up to the renderer.
     *
     * @param marker  the marker (<code>null</code> not permitted).
