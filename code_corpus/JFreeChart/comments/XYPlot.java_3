     * Storage for the mapping between datasets/renderers and domain axes.  The
     * keys in the map are Integer objects, corresponding to the dataset
     * index.  The values in the map are List objects containing Integer
     * objects (corresponding to the axis indices).  If the map contains no
     * entry for a dataset, it is assumed to map to the primary domain axis
     * (index = 0).
