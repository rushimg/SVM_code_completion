    /**
     * Sets the series order and sends a {@link PlotChangeEvent} to all
     * registered listeners.  By default, the plot renders the primary series
     * last (so that the primary series appears to be on top).
     * You can reverse this if you want to.
     *
     * @param order  the rendering order (<code>null</code> not permitted).
     *
