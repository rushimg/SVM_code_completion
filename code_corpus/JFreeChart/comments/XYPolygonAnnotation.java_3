    /**
     * Creates a new annotation (where, by default, the polygon is drawn
     * with a black outline).  The array of polygon coordinates must contain
     * an even number of coordinates (each pair is an (x, y) location on the
     * plot) and the last point is automatically joined back to the first point.
     *
     * @param polygon  the coordinates of the polygon's vertices
     *     (<code>null</code> not permitted).
