/**
 * Represents a sequence of zero or more data items in the form (x, y).  By
 * default, items in the series will be sorted into ascending order by x-value,
 * and duplicate x-values are permitted.  Both the sorting and duplicate
 * defaults can be changed in the constructor.  Y-values can be
 * <code>null</code> to represent missing values.
