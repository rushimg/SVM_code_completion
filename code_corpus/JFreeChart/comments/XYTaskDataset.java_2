/**
 * A dataset implementation that wraps a {@link TaskSeriesCollection} and
 * presents it as an {@link IntervalXYDataset}, allowing a set of tasks to
 * be displayed using an {@link XYBarRenderer} (and usually a
 * {@link SymbolAxis}).  This is a very specialised dataset implementation
 * ---before using it, you should take some time to understand the use-cases
 * that it is designed for.
 *
 * @since 1.0.11
