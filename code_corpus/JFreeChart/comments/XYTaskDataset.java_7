    /**
     * Returns a flag that indicates whether or not the dataset is transposed.
     * The default is <code>false</code> which means the x-values are integers
     * corresponding to the series indices, and the y-values are millisecond
     * values corresponding to the task date/time intervals.  If the flag
     * is set to <code>true</code>, the x and y-values are reversed.
     *
     * @return The flag.
