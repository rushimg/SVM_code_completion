/**
 * A y-value plus the bounds for the related x-interval.  This curious
 * combination exists as an implementation detail, to fit into the structure
 * of the ComparableObjectSeries class.  It would have been possible to
 * simply reuse the {@link YInterval} class by assuming that the y-interval
 * in fact represents the x-interval, however I decided it was better to
 * duplicate some code in order to document the real intent.
