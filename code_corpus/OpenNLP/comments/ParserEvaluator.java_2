/**
 * Class for ParserEvaluator.
 * This ParserEvaluator behaves like EVALB with no exceptions, e.g, 
 * without removing punctuation tags, or equality between ADVP and PRT 
 * (as in COLLINS convention). To follow parsing evaluation conventions
 * (Bikel, Collins, Charniak, etc.) as in EVALB, options are to be added 
 * to the {@code ParserEvaluatorTool}.
