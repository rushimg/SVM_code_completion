/**
 * Utility class to handle Portuguese contractions.
 * <p>
 * Some Corpora splits contractions in its parts, for example, "da" &gt; "de" +
 * "a", but according to the fase of language processing, NER for instance, we
 * can't decide if to split a contraction or not, specially because contractions
 * inside names are not separated, but outside are.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not use this class, internal use only!
