/**
 * Trains models for sequences using the perceptron algorithm.  Each outcome is represented as
 * a binary perceptron classifier.  This supports standard (integer) weighting as well
 * average weighting.  Sequence information is used in a simplified was to that described in:
 * Discriminative Training Methods for Hidden Markov Models: Theory and Experiments
 * with the Perceptron Algorithm. Michael Collins, EMNLP 2002.
 * Specifically only updates are applied to tokens which were incorrectly tagged by a sequence tagger
 * rather than to all feature across the sequence which differ from the training sequence.
