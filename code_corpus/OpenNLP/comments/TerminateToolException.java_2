/**
 * Exception to terminate the execution of a command line tool.
 * <p>
 * The exception should be thrown to indicate that the VM should be terminated with
 * the specified error code, instead of just calling {@link System#exit(int)}.
 * <p>
 * The return code convention is to return:<br>
 * 0 in case of graceful termination<br>
 * -1 in case of runtime errors, such as IOException<br>
 * 1 in case of invalid parameters.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not use this class, internal use only!
