/**
 * An implementation of the Heap interface based on {@link java.util.SortedSet}.
 * This implementation will not allow multiple objects which are equal to be added to the heap.
 * Only use this implementation when object in the heap can be totally ordered (no duplicates).
 *
 * @deprecated not used anymore, when there is need for a heap use ListHeap instead
