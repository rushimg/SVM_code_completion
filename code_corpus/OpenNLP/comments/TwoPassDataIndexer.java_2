/**
 * Collecting event and context counts by making two passes over the events.  The
 * first pass determines which contexts will be used by the model, and the
 * second pass creates the events in memory containing only the contexts which
 * will be used.  This greatly reduces the amount of memory required for storing
 * the events.  During the first pass a temporary event file is created which
 * is read during the second pass.
