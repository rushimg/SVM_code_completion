  // There are two ways in which you can can match the start of a name
  // expression.
  // The first is if you have any number of non-escaping characters
  // The second is if you have any number of any characters, followed
  // by a non-"\" character, as "\" is used to escape the "=".  After
  // that, any number of pairs of "\" are allowed, as we let "\" also
  // escape itself.  After that comes "=" and a name.
