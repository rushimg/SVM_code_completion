/**
 * An abstract base class for dependency grammars.  The only thing you have
 * to implement in a subclass is scoreTB (score a "tag binned" dependency
 * in the tagProjection space).  A subclass also has to either call
 * super() in its constructor, or otherwise initialize the tagBin array.
 * The call to initTagBins() (in the constructor) must be made after all
 * keys have been entered into tagIndex.
