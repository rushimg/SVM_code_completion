   * getBatch is used to generate the next sequence of indices to be passed to the actual function.
   *  Depending on the current sample method this is done by:
   *    Ordered - simply generates the indices 1,2,3,4,....
   *    RandomWithReplacement - Samples uniformly from the set of possible indices
   *    RandomWithoutReplacement - Samples from the set of possible indices removing each used index, then restarting
   *          after each pass
