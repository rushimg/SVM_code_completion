/**
 * This class is designed to apply multiple Annotators
 * to an Annotation.  The idea is that you first
 * build up the pipeline by adding Annotators, and then
 * you take the objects you wish to annotate and pass
 * them in and get back in return a fully annotated object.
 * Please see the package level javadoc for sample usage
 * and a more complete description.
