/**
 * An object for keeping track of Annotators. Typical use is to allow multiple
 * pipelines to share any Annotators in common.
 *
 * For example, if multiple pipelines exist, and they both need a
 * ParserAnnotator, it would be bad to load two such Annotators into memory.
 * Instead, an AnnotatorPool will only create one Annotator and allow both
 * pipelines to share it.
