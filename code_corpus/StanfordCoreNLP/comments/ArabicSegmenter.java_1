/**
 * Arabic word segmentation model based on conditional random fields (CRF).
 * This is a re-implementation (with extensions) of the model described in
 * (Green and DeNero, 2012).
 * <p>
 * This package includes a JFlex-based orthographic normalization package
 * that runs on the input prior to processing by the CRF-based segmentation
 * model. The normalization options are configurable, but must be consistent for
 * both training and test data.
