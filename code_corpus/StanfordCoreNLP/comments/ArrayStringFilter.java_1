/**
 * Filters Strings based on whether they exactly match any string in
 * the array it is initially onstructed with.  Saves some time over
 * using regexes if the array of strings is small enough.  No specific
 * experiments exist for how long the array can be before performance
 * is worse than a regex, but the English dependencies code was helped
 * by replacing disjunction regexes of 6 words or fewer with this.
