/**
 * Implements a finite beam, taking a comparator (default is
 * ScoredComparator.ASCENDING_COMPARATOR, the MAX object according to
 * the comparator is the one to be removed) and a beam size on
 * construction (default is 100).  Adding an object may cause the
 * worst-scored object to be removed from the beam (and that object
 * may well be the newly added object itself).
