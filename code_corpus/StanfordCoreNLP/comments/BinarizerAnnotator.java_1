/**
 * This annotator takes unbinarized trees (from the parser annotator
 * or elsewhere) and binarizes them in the attachment.
 * <br>
 * Note that this functionality is also built in to the
 * ParserAnnotator.  However, this can be used in situations where the
 * trees come from somewhere other than the parser.  Conversely, the
 * ParserAnnotator may have more options for the binarizer which are
 * not implemented here.
