/**
 * A priority queue that has a fixed bounded size.
 * Notice that this class is implemented using a sorted set, which
 * requires consistency between euqals() and compareTo() method.
 * It decides whether two objects are equal based on their compareTo
 * value; in other words, if two objects have the same priority, 
 * only one will be stored.
