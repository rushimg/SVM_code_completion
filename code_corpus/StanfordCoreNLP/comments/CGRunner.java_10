  /**
   * Solves the problem using OWLQN.  The solution
   * is stored in the {@code lambda} array of {@code prob}.  Note that the
   * likelihood function will be a penalized L2 likelihood function unless you
   * have turned this off via setting the priorSigmaS to 0.0.
   *
   * @param weight Controls the sparseness/regularization of the L1 solution.
   *     The bigger the number the sparser the solution.  Weights between
   *     0.01 and 1.0 typically give good performance.
