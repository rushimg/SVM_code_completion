/**
 * Evaluates CRFClassifier on a set of data
 * - called by QNMinimizer periodically
 * - If evalCmd is set, runs command line specified by evalCmd
 *                      otherwise does evaluation internally
 *   NOTE: when running conlleval with exec on Linux, linux will first
 *          fork process by duplicating memory of current process.  So if
 *          JVM has lots of memory, it will all be duplicated when
 *          child process is initially forked.
