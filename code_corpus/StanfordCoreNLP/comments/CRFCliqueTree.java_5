  /**
   * returns the log probability for the given labels (indexed using
   * classIndex), where the last label corresponds to the label at the specified
   * position. For instance if you called logProb(5, {1,2,3}) it will return the
   * marginal log prob that the label at position 3 is 1, the label at position
   * 4 is 2 and the label at position 5 is 3.
