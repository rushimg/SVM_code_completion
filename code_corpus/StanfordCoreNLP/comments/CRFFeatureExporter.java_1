/**
 * Exports CRF features for use with other programs.
 * Usage: CRFFeatureExporter -prop crfClassifierPropFile -trainFile inputFile -exportFeatures outputFile
 * - Output file is automatically gzipped/b2zipped if ending in gz/bz2
 * - bzip2 requires that bzip2 is available via command line
 * - Currently exports features in a format that can be read by a modified crfsgd
 *   (crfsgd assumes features are gzipped)
 * TODO: Support other formats (like crfsuite)
