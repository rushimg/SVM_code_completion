/**
 * The {@code CTBTreeReaderFactory} is a factory for creating a
 * TreeReader suitable for the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB).
 * It knows how to ignore the SGML tags in those files.
 * The default reader doesn't delete empty nodes, but an
 * additional static class is provided whose default constructor
 * does give a TreeReader that deletes empty nodes in trees.
