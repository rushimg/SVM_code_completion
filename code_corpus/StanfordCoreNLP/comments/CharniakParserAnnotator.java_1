/**
 * This class will add parse information to an Annotation from the BLLIP parser.
 * It allows you to use the Charniak parser or Charniak and Johnson reranking parser
 * along with any existing parser and reranking model.
 *
 * It assumes that the Annotation already contains the tokenized words
 * as a {@code List<List<CoreLabel>>} under
 * {@code CoreAnnotations.SentencesAnnotation.class}.
 * If the words have POS tags, they will not be used.
