 * Stores, trains, and scores with an unknown word model.  A couple

 * nouns, dates, and cardinal and ordinal numbers; when none of these
 * filters are met, either the distribution of terminals with the same
 * first character is used, or Good-Turing smoothing is used. Although
 * this is developed for Chinese, the training and storage methods
 * could be used cross-linguistically.
