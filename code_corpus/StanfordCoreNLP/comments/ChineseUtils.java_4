   *  <code>ChineseUtils ascii spaceChar word*</code>
   *  <p>
   *  ascii and spaceChar are integers: 0 = leave, 1 = ascii, 2 = fullwidth.
   *  The words listed are then normalized and sent to stdout.
   *  If no words are given, the program reads from and normalizes stdin.
   *  Input is assumed to be in UTF-8.
   *
   *  @param args Command line arguments as above
   *  @throws IOException If any problems accessing command-line files
