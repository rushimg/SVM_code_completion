  /**
   * For certain phrases, we change the SBAR to a PP to get prep/pcomp
   * dependencies.  For example, in "The day after the airline was
   * planning...", we want prep(day, after) and pcomp(after,
   * planning).  If "after the airline was planning" was parsed as an
   * SBAR, either by the parser or in the treebank, we fix that here.
