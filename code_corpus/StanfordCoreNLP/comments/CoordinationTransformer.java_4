  /**
   * Removes the SQ structure under a WHNP question, such as "Who am I
   * to judge?".  We do this so that it is easier to pick out the head
   * and then easier to connect that head to all of the other words in
   * the question in this situation.  In the specific case of making
   * the copula head, we don't do this so that the existing headfinder
   * code can easily find the "am" or other copula verb.
