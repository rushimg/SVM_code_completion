   * Given a tree t, if this tree contains a CC inside a NP followed by 2 nodes
   * (i.e. we have a flat structure that will not work for the dependencies),
   * it will call transform CC on the NP containing the CC and the index of the
   * CC, and then return the root of the whole transformed tree.
   * If it finds no such tree, this method returns null.
