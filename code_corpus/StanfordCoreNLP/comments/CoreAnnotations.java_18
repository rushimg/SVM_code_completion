  /**
   * This indexes a token number inside a sentence.  Standardly, tokens are
   * indexed within a sentence starting at 1 (not 0: we follow common parlance
   * whereby we speak of the first word of a sentence).
   * This is generally an individual word or feature index - it is local, and
   * may not be uniquely identifying without other identifiers such as sentence
   * and doc. However, if these are the same, the index annotation should be a
   * unique identifier for differentiating objects.
