   * This indexes the beginning of a span of words, e.g., a constituent in a
   * tree. See {@link edu.stanford.nlp.trees.Tree#indexSpans(int)}.
   * This annotation counts tokens.
   * It standardly indexes from 1 (like IndexAnnotation).  The reasons for
   * this are: (i) Talking about the first word of a sentence is kind of
   * natural, and (ii) We use index 0 to refer to an imaginary root in
   * dependency output.
