  /**
   * The CoreMap key for getting the token-level named entity tag (e.g., DATE,
   * PERSON, etc.) from a previous NER tagger. NERFeatureFactory is sensitive to
   * this tag and will turn the annotations from the previous NER tagger into
   * new features. This is currently used to implement one level of stacking --
   * we may later change it to take a list as needed.
   *
   * This key is typically set on token annotations.
