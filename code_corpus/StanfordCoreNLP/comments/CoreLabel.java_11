  /**
   * Return a non-null String value for a key.
   * This method is included for backwards compatibility with AbstractMapLabel.
   * It is guaranteed to not return null; if the key is not present or
   * has a null value, it returns the empty string ("").  It is only valid to
   * call this method when key is paired with a value of type String.
   *
   * @param <KEY> A key type with a String value
   * @param key The key to return the value of.
   * @return "" if the key is not in the map or has the value <code>null</code>
   *     and the String value of the key otherwise
