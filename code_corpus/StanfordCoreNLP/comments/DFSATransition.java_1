/**
 * (D)FSA Transition
 * <p/>
 * Class for representing a transition in a weighted finite state
 * transducer.  For now, just null out fields that may not apply.
 * This should really be FSATransition as there's nothing
 * deterministic-specific.  If FSA is ever made, this should be
 * abstracted.  The ID is a descriptor, not a unique ID.
