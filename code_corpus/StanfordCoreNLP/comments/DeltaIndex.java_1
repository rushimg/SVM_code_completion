/**
 * A class that has a backing index, such as a hash index you don't
 * want changed, and another index which will hold extra entries that
 * get added during the life of the index.
 * <br>
 * It is important that nothing else changes the backing index while
 * a DeltaIndex is in use.  The behavior of this index is
 * undefined if the backing index changes, although in general the new
 * entries in the backing index will be ignored.
