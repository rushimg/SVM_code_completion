/**
 * An individual dependency between a governor and a dependent.
 * The governor and dependent are represented as a Label.
 * For example, these can be a
 * Word or a WordTag.  If one wishes the dependencies to preserve positions
 * in a sentence, then each can be a LabeledConstituent or CoreLabel.
 * Dependencies support an Object naming the dependency type.  This may be
 * null.  Dependencies have factories.
