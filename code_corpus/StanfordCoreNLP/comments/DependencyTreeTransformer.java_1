/**
 * Transforms an English structure parse tree in order to get the dependencies right:  <br>
 *  -- put a ROOT node  <br>
 *  -- remove NONE nodes  <br>
 *  -- retain only NP-TMP, NP-ADV, UCP-TMP tags  <br>
 * The UCP- tags will later be turned into NP- anyway <br>
 *
 * (Note [cdm]: A lot of this overlaps other existing functionality in trees.
 * Could aim to unify it.)
