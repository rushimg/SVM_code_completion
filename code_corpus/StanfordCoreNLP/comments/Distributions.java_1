/**
 * Static methods for operating on {@link Distributions}s.
 *
 * In general, if a method is operating on a pair of Distribution objects, we imagine that the
 * set of possible keys for each Distribution is the same.
 * Therefore we require that d1.numberOFKeys = d2.numberOfKeys and that the number of keys in the union
 * of the two key sets <= numKeys
