  /**
   * Calculates the information radius (aka the Jensen-Shannon divergence)
   * between the two Distributions.  This measure is defined as:
   * <blockquote> iRad(p,q) = D(p||(p+q)/2)+D(q,(p+q)/2) </blockquote>
   * where p is one Distribution, q is the other distribution, and D(p||q) is the
   * KL divergence bewteen p and q.  Note that iRad(p,q) = iRad(q,p).
   *
   * @return The information radius between the distributions
