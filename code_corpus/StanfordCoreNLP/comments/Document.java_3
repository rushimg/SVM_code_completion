  /**
   * Returns a new empty Document with the same meta-data (title, labels, etc)

   * implementations of this method. This method is primarily used by the
   * processing API, so the input document can be preserved and the output
   * document can maintain the meta-data of the in document.
   *
   * @return An empty document of the right sort.
