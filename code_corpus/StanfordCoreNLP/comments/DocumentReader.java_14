   * Reads the next document's worth of text from the reader and turns it into

   * and passes it to {@link #parseDocumentText} to create the document.
   * Subclasses may wish to override either or both of those methods to handle
   * custom formats of document collections and individual documents
   * respectively. This method can also be overridden in its entirety to
   * provide custom reading and construction of documents from input text.
