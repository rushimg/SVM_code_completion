  /**
   * Constructs a new DocumentReader that will read text from the given
   * Reader and tokenize it into words using the given Tokenizer. The default
   * implementation will internally buffer the reader if it is not already
   * buffered, so there is no need to pre-wrap the reader with a BufferedReader.
   * This class provides many <tt>getReader</tt> methods for conviniently
   * reading from many input sources.
