/**
 * The class <code>DoubleAD</code> was created to extend the
 * current calculations of gradient to automatically include a calculation of the
 * hessian vector product with another vector <code>v</code>.  This is used with the
 * Stochastic Meta Descent Optimization, but could be extended for use in any application
 * that requires an additional order of differentiation without explicitly creating the code.
