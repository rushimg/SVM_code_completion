   * This method reads a file of raw word vectors, with a given expected size, and returns a map of word to vector.

   * The file should be in the format <br>

   * If vectors in the file are smaller than expectedSize, an
   * exception is thrown.  If vectors are larger, the vectors are
   * truncated and a warning is printed.
