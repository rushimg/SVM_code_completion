  /**
   * This method takes as input two files: wordFile (one word per line) and a raw word vector file
   * with a given expected size, and returns a map of word to vector.
   * <br>
   * The word vector file should be in the format <br>
   * <code>X1 X2 X3 ...</code> <br>
   * If vectors in the file are smaller than expectedSize, an
   * exception is thrown.  If vectors are larger, the vectors are
   * truncated and a warning is printed.
