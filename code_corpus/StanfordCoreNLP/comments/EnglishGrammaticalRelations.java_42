   * The "discourse element" grammatical relation. This is used for interjections and
   * other discourse particles and elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure
   * of the sentence, except in an expressive way). We generally follow the
   * guidelines of what the Penn Treebanks count as an INTJ.  They
   * define this to include: interjections (oh, uh-huh, Welcome), fillers (um, ah),
   * and discourse markers (well, like, actually, but not: you know).
   * We also use it for emoticons.
