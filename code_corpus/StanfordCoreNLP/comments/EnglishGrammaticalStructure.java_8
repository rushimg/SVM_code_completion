   * What we do in this method is look for temporary dependencies of
   * the type "rel".  These occur in sentences such as "I saw the man
   * who you love".  In that case, we should produce dobj(love, who).
   * On the other hand, in the sentence "... which Mr. Bush was
   * fighting for", we should have pobj(for, which).
