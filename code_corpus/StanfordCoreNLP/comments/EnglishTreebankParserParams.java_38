     * Mark S/SINV/SQ nodes according to verbal tag.  Meanings are:
     * 0 = no subcategorization.
     * 1 = mark with head tag
     * 2 = mark only -VBF if VBZ/VBD/VBP/MD tag
     * 3 = as 2 and mark -VBNF if TO/VBG/VBN/VB
     * 4 = as 2 but only mark S not SINV/SQ
     * 5 = as 3 but only mark S not SINV/SQ
     * Previously seen as bad.  Option 4 might be promising now.
