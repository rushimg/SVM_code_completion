     * Mark phrases which are conjunctions.
     * 0 = No marking
     * 1 = Any phrase with a CC daughter that isn't first or last.  Possibly marginally positive.
     * 2 = As 0 but also a non-marginal CONJP daughter.  In principle good, but no gains.
     * 3 = More like Charniak.  Not yet implemented.  Need to annotate _before_ annotate children!
     *     np or vp with two or more np/vp children, a comma, cc or conjp, and nothing else.
