     * Collins-style marking, where an extra NP node is inserted above a
     * baseNP, if it isn't
     * already in an NP over NP construction, as in Collins 1999.
     * <i>This option shouldn't really be in EnglishTrain since it's needed
     * at parsing time.  But we don't currently use it....</i>
     * A value of 1 is good.
