    /** Split SBAR nodes.
     *  1 = mark 'in order to' purpose clauses; this is actually a small and
     *  inconsistent part of what is marked SBAR-PRP in the treebank, which
     *  is mainly 'because' reason clauses.
     *  2 = mark all infinitive SBAR.
     *  3 = do 1 and 2.
     *  A value of 1 seems minutely positive; 2 and 3 seem negative.
     *  Also get 'in case Sfin', 'In order to', and on one occasion
     *  'in order that'
