  /**
   * How annotations be extracted from the MatchedExpression
   * If the result type is a List and more than one annotation key is specified,
   *   then the result is paired with the annotation key
   *   Example: If annotation key is [ner,normalized] and result is [CITY,San Francisco]
   *            then the final coremap will have ner=CITY, normalized=San Francisco
   * Otherwise, the result is treated as one object (all keys will be assigned that value).
