  /**
   * Mapping of variables that can be expanded in a regular expression for strings,
   *   to their regular expressions.
   * The variable name must start with "$" and include only the alphanumeric characters
   *   (it should follow the pattern <code>$[A-Za-z0-9_]+</code>).
   * Each variable is mapped to a pair, consisting of the <code>Pattern</code> representing
   *   the name of the variable to be replaced, and a <code>String</code> representing the
   *   regular expression (escaped) that is used to replace the name of the variable.
