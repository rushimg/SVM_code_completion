  /**
   * Maximum ySize.
   * todo [CDM May 2007]: What is this and what does it control?  Why isn't it set dynamically?
   * Is it the number of different y values that one x value can have?
   * If so, although it was set to 5, it should be 7 for the WSJ PTB.
   * But that doesn't solve the problem for the data set after that....
   * See the commented out bits where it should exception if it overflows.
   * Should just be able to make it dynamic
