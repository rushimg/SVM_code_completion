/** Provides a much faster way to realize the factored
 *  parsing idea, including easily returning "k good" results
 *  at the expense of optimality.  Exploiting the k best functionality
 *  of the ExhaustivePCFGParser, this model simply gets more than
 *  k best PCFG parsers, scores them according to the dependency
 *  grammar, and returns them in terms of their product score.
 *  No actual parsing is done.
