   * This will contain the (x,y) pairs for which the feature is non-zero in
   * case it is sparse.
   * The pairs (x,y) are coded as x*ySize+y. The values are kept in valuesI.
   * For example, if a feature has only two non-zero values, e.g f(1,2)=3
   * and f(6,3)=0.74, then indexedValues will have values
   * indexedValues={1*ySize+2,6*ySize+2} and valuesI will be {3,.74}
