/**
 * The <code>FilePathProcessor</code> traverses a directory structure and
 * applies the <code>processFile</code> method to files meeting some
 * criterion.  It is implemented as static methods, not as an extension of
 * <code>File</code>.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note:</i> This is used in our old code in ling/trees, but newer code
 * should probably use io.FileSequentialCollection
