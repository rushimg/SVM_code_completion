/**
 * A priority queue based on a binary heap.  This implementation trades
 * flexibility for speed: while it is up to 2x faster than {@link
 * BinaryHeapPriorityQueue} and nearly as fast as {@link
 * java.util.PriorityQueue}, it does not support removing or changing the
 * priority of an element.  Also, while {@link #getPriority(Object key)
 * getPriority(Object key)} is supported, performance will be linear, not
 * constant.
