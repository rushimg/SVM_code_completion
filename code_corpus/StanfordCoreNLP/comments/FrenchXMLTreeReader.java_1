/**
 * A reader for XML format French Treebank files. Note that the raw
 * XML files are in ISO-8859-1 format, so they must be converted to UTF-8.
 * <p>
 * Handles multiword expressions (MWEs).
 * <p>
 * One difference worth documenting between this and the
 * PennTreeReader is that this does not unescape \* and \/ the way the
 * PennTreeReader does.  The French Treebank we are using does not
 * use those escapings.
