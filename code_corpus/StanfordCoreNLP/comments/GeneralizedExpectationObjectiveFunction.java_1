 * Implementation of Generalized Expectation Objective function for
 * an I.I.D. log-linear model. See Mann and McCallum, ACL 2008.
 * IMPORTANT: the current implementation is only correct as long as
 * the labeled features passed to GE are binary.
 * However, other features are allowed to be real valued.
 * The original paper also discusses GE only for binary features.
