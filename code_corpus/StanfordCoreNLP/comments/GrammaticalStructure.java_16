  /**
   * Get the typed dependencies after collapsing them.
   * Collapsing dependencies refers to turning certain function words
   * such as prepositions and conjunctions into arcs, so they disappear from
   * the set of nodes.
   * There is no guarantee that the dependencies are a tree. While the
   * dependencies are normally tree-like, the collapsing may introduce
   * not only re-entrancies but even small cycles.
   *
   * @return A set of collapsed dependencies
