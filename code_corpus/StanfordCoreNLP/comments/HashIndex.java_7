   * The current implementation returns the actual index list, not a defensive copy.  Messing with this List
   * can seriously screw up the state of the Index.  (perhaps this method needs to be eliminated? I don't think it's
   * ever used in ways that we couldn't use the Index itself for directly.  --Roger, 12/29/04)
