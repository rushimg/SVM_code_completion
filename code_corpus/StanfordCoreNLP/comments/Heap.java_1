/**
 * Heap interface.
 * These heaps implement a decreaseKey operation, which requires
 * a separate Object to Index map, and for objects to be unique in the Heap.
 * <p/>
 * An interface cannot specify constructors, but it is nevertheless
 * expected that an implementation of this interface has a constructor
 * that takes a Comparator, which is used for ordering ("scoring")
 * objects:
 * <code>public Heap(Comparator cmp) {}</code>
