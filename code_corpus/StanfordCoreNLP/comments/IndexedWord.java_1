/**
 * This class is mainly for use with RTE in terms of the methods it provides,
 * but on a more general level, it provides a {@link CoreLabel} that uses its
 * DocIDAnnotation, SentenceIndexAnnotation, and IndexAnnotation to implement
 * Comparable/compareTo, hashCode, and equals.  This means no other annotations,
 * including the identity of the word, are taken into account when using these
 * methods.
