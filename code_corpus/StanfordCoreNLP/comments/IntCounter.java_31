  /**
   * Finds and returns the key in this Counter with the largest count.
   * Ties are broken by comparing the objects using the given tie breaking
   * Comparator, favoring Objects that are sorted to the front. This is useful
   * if the keys are numeric and there is a bias to prefer smaller or larger
   * values, and can be useful in other circumstances where random tie-breaking
   * is not desirable. Returns null if this Counter is empty.
