  /**
   * Finds and returns the key in this Counter with the smallest count.
   * Ties are broken according to the natural ordering of the objects.
   * This will prefer smaller numeric keys and lexicographically earlier
   * String keys. To use a different tie-breaking Comparator, use
   * {@link #argmin(Comparator)}. Returns null if this Counter is empty.
