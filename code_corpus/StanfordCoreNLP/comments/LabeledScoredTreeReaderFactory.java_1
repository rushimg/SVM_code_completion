/**
 * This class implements a <code>TreeReaderFactory</code> that produces
 * labeled, scored array-based Trees, which have been cleaned up to
 * delete empties, etc.   This seems to be a common case (for English).
 * By default, the labels are of type CategoryWordTag,
 * but a different Label type can be specified by the user.
