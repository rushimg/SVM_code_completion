/**
 * Implementation of the Leaf Ancestor metric first described by Sampson and Babarczy (2003) and
 * later analyzed more completely by Clegg and Shepherd (2005).
 * <p>
 * This implementation assumes that the guess/gold input files are of equal length, and have one tree per
 * line.
 * <p>
 * TODO (spenceg): This implementation doesn't insert the "boundary symbols" as described by both
 * Sampson and Clegg. Need to add those.
