  /**
   * Returns the String output of the parse of the given query.
   * <br>
   * The "parse" method in the server is mostly useful for clients
   * using a language other than Java who don't want to import or wrap
   * Tree in any way.  However, it is useful to provide getParse to
   * test that functionality in the server.
