  /** Adds a sentence final punctuation mark to sentences that lack one.
   *  This method adds a period (the first sentence final punctuation word
   *  in a parser language pack) to sentences that don't have one within
   *  the last 3 words (to allow for close parentheses, etc.).  It checks
   *  tags for punctuation, if available, otherwise words.
   *
   *  @param sentence The sentence to check
   *  @param length The length of the sentence (just to avoid recomputation)
