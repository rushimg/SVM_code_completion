  /**
   * Trains the linear classifier using Generalized Expectation criteria as described in
   * <tt>Generalized Expectation Criteria for Semi Supervised Learning of Conditional Random Fields</tt>, Mann and McCallum, ACL 2008.
   * The original algorithm is proposed for CRFs but has been adopted to LinearClassifier (which is a simpler special case of a CRF).
   * IMPORTANT: the labeled features that are passed as an argument are assumed to be binary valued, although
   * other features are allowed to be real valued.
