  /**
   * Trains the linear classifier using Generalized Expectation criteria as described in
   * <tt>Generalized Expectation Criteria for Semi Supervised Learning of Conditional Random Fields</tt>, Mann and McCallum, ACL 2008.
   * The original algorithm is proposed for CRFs but has been adopted to LinearClassifier (which is a simpler, special case of a CRF).
   * Automatically discovers high precision, high frequency labeled features to be used as GE constraints.
   * IMPORTANT: the current feature selector assumes the features are binary. The GE constraints assume the constraining features are binary anyway, although
   * it doesn't make such assumptions about other features.
