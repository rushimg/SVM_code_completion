  /** If set to true, then when training a classifier, after an optimal sigma is chosen a model is relearned from
   * scratch. If set to false (the default), then the model is updated from wherever it wound up in the sigma-tuning process.
   * The latter is likely to be faster, but it's not clear which model will wind up better.  */
