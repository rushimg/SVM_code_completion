  /**
   * Stores the predictions of the extractors
   * The first index is the partition number (of length 1 is cross validation is not enabled)
   * The second index is the task: 0 - entities, 1 - relations, 2 - events
   * Note: we need to store separate predictions per task because they may not be compatible with each other.
   *       For example, we may have predicted entities in task 0 but use gold entities for task 1.
