  /**
   * Returns a lexicon-based segmentation. At each position x in the input string,
   * it attempts to find largest value y, so that [x,y] is part of the lexicon.
   * Then, it tried to match more input from position y+1. This greedy algorithm
   * (taken from edu.stanford.nlp.lexparser.MaxMatchSegmenter) has no theoretical
   * guarantee, and it would be wise to use segmentWords instead.
   *
   * @param s Input (unsegmented) string.
   * @return Segmented sentence.
