  /**
   * Constructor for a tagger, loading a model stored in a particular file,
   * classpath resource, or URL.
   * The tagger data is loaded when the constructor is called (this can be
   * slow). This constructor first constructs a TaggerConfig object, which
   * loads the tagger options from the modelFile.
   *
   * @param modelFile Filename, classpath resource, or URL for the trained model
   * @throws RuntimeIOException if I/O errors or serialization errors
