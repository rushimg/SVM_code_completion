  /**
   * Uses an XML transformer to turn an input stream into a bunch of
   * output.  Tags all of the text between xmlTags.
   *
   * The difference between using this and using runTagger in XML mode
   * is that this preserves the XML structure outside of the list of
   * elements to tag, whereas the runTagger method throws away all of
   * the surrounding structure and returns tagged plain text.
