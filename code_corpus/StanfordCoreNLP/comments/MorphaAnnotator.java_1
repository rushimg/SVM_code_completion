/**
 * This class will add the lemmas of all the words to the Annotation.
 * It assumes that the Annotation already contains the tokenized words as
 * a {@code List<CoreLabel>} for a list of sentences under the
 * {@code SentencesAnnotation.class} key.
 * The Annotator adds lemma information to each CoreLabel,
 * in the LemmaAnnotation.class.
