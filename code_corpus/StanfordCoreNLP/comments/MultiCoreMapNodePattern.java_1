/**
 * Pattern for matching across multiple core maps.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class allows for string matches across tokens.  It is not implemented efficiently
 * (it basically creates a big pretend token and tries to do string match on that)
 * so can be expensive to use.  Whenever possible, <code>SequencePattern</code> should be used instead.
