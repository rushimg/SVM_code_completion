/**
 * a multinomial distribution.  pretty straightforward.  specify the parameters with
 * a counter.  It is assumed that the Counter's keySet() contains all of the parameters (i.e., there are not other
 * possible values which are set to 0).  It makes a copy of the Counter, so tha parameters cannot be changes,
 * and it normalizes the values if they are not already normalized.
