 *         A Naive Bayes classifier with a fixed number of features.
 *         The features are assumed to have integer values even though RVFDatum will return doubles
 * @author Sarah Spikes (sdspikes@cs.stanford.edu) - Templatization.  Not sure what the weights counter
 *         is supposed to hold; given the weights function it seems to hold Pair<Pair<L, F>, Object>
 *         but this seems like a strange thing to expect to be passed in.
