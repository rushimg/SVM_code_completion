/**
 * This calls NumberSequenceClassifier, which is a rule based classifier, which
 * adds a NUMBER entity tag to numbers not already given another entity tag, and
 * also has additional rules for marking MONEY, TIME, and DATE. It assumes that
 * tokens already have a (POS) TagAnnotation, and an original round of NER that
 * covers MONEY and American DATE/TIME formats, such as MUC NER in
 * AnswerAnnotation, to which we add.
