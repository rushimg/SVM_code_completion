   * Modular classification using NumberNormalizer for numbers, SUTime for date/time.
   * Note: this is slower than classifyOld because it runs multiple passes
   *   over the tokens (one for numbers and dates, and others for money and ordinals).
   *   However, the slowdown is not substantial since the passes are fast. Plus,
   *   the code is much cleaner than before...
