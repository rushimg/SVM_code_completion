/**
 * This class is used to wrap the ObjectBank used by the sequence
 * models and is where any sort of general processing, like the IOB mapping
 * stuff and wordshape stuff, should go.
 * It checks the SeqClassifierFlags to decide what to do.
 * <p>
 * TODO: We should rearchitect this so that the FeatureFactory-specific
 * stuff is done by a callback to the relevant FeatureFactory.
