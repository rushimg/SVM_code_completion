  /**
   * "double count" tags rewrites as word in PCFG and Dep parser.  Good for
   * combined parsing only (it used to not kick in for PCFG parsing).  This
   * option is only used at Test time, but it is now in Options, so the
   * correct choice for a grammar is recorded by a serialized parser.
   * You should turn this off for a vanilla PCFG parser.
