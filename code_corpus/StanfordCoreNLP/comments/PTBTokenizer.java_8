  /**
   * Returns a presentable version of the given PTB-tokenized text.
   * PTB tokenization splits up punctuation and does various other things
   * that makes simply joining the tokens with spaces look bad. So join
   * the tokens with space and run it through this method to produce nice
   * looking text. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well.
   *
   * @param ptbText A String in PTB3-escaped form
   * @return An approximation to the original String
