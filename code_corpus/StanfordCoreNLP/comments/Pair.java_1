/**
 * Pair is a Class for holding mutable pairs of objects.
 *
 * <i>Implementation note:</i>
 * on a 32-bit JVM uses ~ 8 (this) + 4 (first) + 4 (second) = 16 bytes.
 * on a 64-bit JVM uses ~ 16 (this) + 8 (first) + 8 (second) = 32 bytes.
 *
 * Many applications use a lot of Pairs so it's good to keep this
 * number small.
