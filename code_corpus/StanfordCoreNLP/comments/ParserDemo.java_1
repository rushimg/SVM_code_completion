   * The main method demonstrates the easiest way to load a parser.
   * Simply call loadModel and specify the path of a serialized grammar
   * model, which can be a file, a resource on the classpath, or even a URL.
   * For example, this demonstrates loading from the models jar file, which
   * you therefore need to include in the classpath for ParserDemo to work.
