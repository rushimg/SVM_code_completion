  /**
   * This class does the processing of the dialog box to a file.  It
   * also checks the cancelled variable after each processing to see
   * if the user has chosen to cancel.  After running, it changes the
   * label on the "cancel" button, waits a couple seconds, and then
   * hides whatever dialog was passed in when originally created.
