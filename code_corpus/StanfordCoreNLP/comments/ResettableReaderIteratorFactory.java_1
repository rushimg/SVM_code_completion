/**
 * Vends ReaderIterators which can always be rewound.
 * Java's Readers cannot be reset, but this ReaderIteratorFactory allows resetting.
 * It the input types are anything other than Readers, then it resets them in
 * the obvious way.  If the input is a Reader, then it's contents are saved
 * to a tmp file (which is destroyed when the VM exits) which is then resettable.
