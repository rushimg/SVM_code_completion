/** This is a very simple demo of calling the Chinese Word Segmenter
 *  programmatically.  It assumes an input file in UTF8.
 *  <p/>
 *  <code>
 *  Usage: java -mx1g -cp seg.jar SegDemo fileName
 *  </code>
 *  This will run correctly in the distribution home directory.  To
 *  run in general, the properties for where to find dictionaries or
 *  normalizations have to be set.
