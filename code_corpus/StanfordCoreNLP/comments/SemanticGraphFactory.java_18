  /**
   * Given a list of graphs, constructs a new graph combined from the
   * collection of graphs.  Original vertices are used, edges are
   * copied.  Graphs are ordered by the sentence index and index of
   * the original vertices.  Intent is to create a "mega graph"
   * similar to the graphs used in the RTE problem.
   * <br>
   * This method only works if the indexed words have different
   * sentence ids, as otherwise the maps used will confuse several of
   * the IndexedWords.
