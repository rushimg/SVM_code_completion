  /**
   * Given a set of edges, and a mapping between the replacement and target vertices that comprise the
   * vertices of the edges, returns a new set of edges with the replacement vertices.  If a replacement
   * is not present, the WILDCARD_VERTICE is used in its place (i.e. can be anything).
   *
   * Currently used to generate "generic" versions of Semantic Graphs, when given a list of generic
   * vertices to replace with, but can conceivably be used for other purposes where vertices must
   * be replaced.
