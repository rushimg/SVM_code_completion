   * This is the method to call for assigning labels and node vectors

   * have the node vector and the predictions of their classes
   * assigned to that subtree's node.  The annotations filled in are
   * the RNNCoreAnnotations.NodeVector, Predictions, and
   * PredictedClass.  In general, PredictedClass will be the most
   * useful annotation except when training.
