/**
 * A <code>SimpleConstituent</code> object defines a generic edge in a graph.
 * The <code>SimpleConstituent</code> records only the endpoints of the
 * <code>Constituent</code>, as two integers.
 * It doesn't label the edges.
 * (It doesn't implement equals() since this actually decreases
 * performance on a non-final class (requires dynamic resolution of which
 * to call).)
