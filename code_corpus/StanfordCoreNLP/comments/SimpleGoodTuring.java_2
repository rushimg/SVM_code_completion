  /**
   * Each instance of this class encapsulates the computation of the smoothing
   * for one probability distribution.  The constructor takes two arguments
   * which are two parallel arrays.  The first is an array of counts, which must
   * be positive and in ascending order.  The second is an array of
   * corresponding counts of counts; that is, for each i, n[i] represents the
   * number of types which occurred with count r[i] in the underlying
   * collection.  See the documentation for main() for a concrete example.
