   * Right now this outputs trees in PTB format.  It outputs one tree
   * at a time until we have output enough trees to fill the given
   * file, then moves on to the next file.  Trees are output in the
   * order given in the <code>ids</code> list.
   * <br>
   * Trees have their words replaced with the words' lemmas, if those
   * lemmas exist.
