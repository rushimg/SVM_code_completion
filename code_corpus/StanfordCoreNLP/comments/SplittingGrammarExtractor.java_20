   * Given a tree and the original set of transition probabilities
   * from one state to the next in the tree, along with a list of the
   * weights in the tree and a count of the mass in each substate at
   * the current node, this method merges the probabilities as
   * necessary.  The results go into newUnaryTransitions and
   * newBinaryTransitions.
