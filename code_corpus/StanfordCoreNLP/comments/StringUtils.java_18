  /**
   * Splits a string into whitespace tokenized fields based on a delimiter. For example,
   * "aa bb | bb cc | ccc ddd" would be split into "[aa,bb],[bb,cc],[ccc,ddd]" based on
   * the delimiter "|". This method uses the old StringTokenizer class, which is up to
   * 3x faster than the regex-based "split()" methods.
