  /**
   * This method converts a comma-separated String (with whitespace
   * optionally allowed after the comma) representing properties
   * to a Properties object.  Each property is "property=value".  The value
   * for properties without an explicitly given value is set to "true". This can be used for a 2nd level
   * of properties, for example, when you have a commandline argument like "-outputOptions style=xml,tags".
