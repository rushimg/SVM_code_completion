  /**
   * A simpler form of command line argument parsing.
   * Dan thinks this is highly superior to the overly complexified code that
   * comes before it.
   * Parses command line arguments into a Map. Arguments of the form
   * -flag1 arg1 -flag2 -flag3 arg3
   * will be parsed so that the flag is a key in the Map (including the hyphen)
   * and the
   * optional argument will be its value (if present).
   *
   * @return A Map from keys to possible values (String or null)
