  /**
   * Computes the longest common substring of s and t.
   * The longest common substring of a and b is the longest run of
   * characters that appear in order inside both a and b. Both a and b
   * may have other extraneous characters along the way. This is like
   * edit distance but with no substitution and a higher number means
   * more similar. For example, the LCS of "abcD" and "aXbc" is 3 (abc).
