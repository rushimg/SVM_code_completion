  /**
   * Computes the Levenshtein (edit) distance of the two given Strings.
   * This method doesn't allow transposition, so one character transposed between two strings has a cost of 2 (one insertion, one deletion).
   * The EditDistance class also implements the Levenshtein distance, but does allow transposition.
