/**
 * Options to the parser which affect performance only at testing (parsing)
 * time.
 * <br>
 * The Options class that stores the TestOptions stores the
 * TestOptions as a transient object.  This means that whatever
 * options get set at creation time are forgotten when the parser is
 * serialized.  If you want an option to be remembered when the parser
 * is reloaded, put it in either TrainOptions or in Options itself.
