  /**
   * The maximum number of edges and hooks combined that the factored parser
   * will build before giving up.  This number should probably be relative to
   * the sentence length parsed. In general, though, if the parser cannot parse
   * a sentence after this much work then there is no good parse consistent
   * between the PCFG and Dependency parsers.  (Normally, depending on other
   * flags), the parser will then just return the best PCFG parse.)
