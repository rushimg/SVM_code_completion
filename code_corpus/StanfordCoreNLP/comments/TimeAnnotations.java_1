/**
 * Set of common annotations for {@link edu.stanford.nlp.util.CoreMap}s 
 * that require classes from the time package.  See 
 * {@link CoreAnnotations} for more information.  This class exists 
 * so that {@link CoreAnnotations} need not depend on timex classes,
 * which in particular pull in the xom.jar package.
