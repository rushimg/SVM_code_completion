  /**
   * Mark all unary nodes specially.  Good for just PCFG. Bad for factored.
   * markUnary affects phrasal nodes. A value of 0 means to do nothing;
   * a value of 1 means to mark the parent (higher) node of a unary rewrite.
   * A value of 2 means to mark the child (lower) node of a unary rewrie.
   * Values of 1 and 2 only apply if the child (lower) node is phrasal.
   * (A value of 1 is better than 2 in combos.)  A value of 1 corresponds
   * to the old boolean -unary flag.
