/** This class wraps another Treebank, and will vend trees that have been through
 *  a TreeTransformer.  You can access them via requests like <code>apply()</code> or
 *  <code>iterator()</code>.
 *  <p>
 *  <i>Important note</i>: This class will only function properly if the TreeTransformer
 *  used is a function (which doesn't change its argument) rather than if it is a
 *  TreeMunger.
