/**
 * An interface which defines a transition type in the shift-reduce
 * parser.  Expected transition types are shift, unary, binary,
 * finalize, and idle.  
 * <br>
 * There is also a compound unary transition for combining multiple
 * unary transitions into one, which lets us prevent the parser from
 * creating arbitrary unary transition sequences.
