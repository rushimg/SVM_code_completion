    /* Sister annotation. Potential problem: if multiple sisters are
     * strong indicators for a single category's expansions.  This
     * happens concretely in the Chinese Treebank when NP (object)
     * has left sisters VV and AS.  Could lead to too much
     * sparseness.  The ideal solution would be to give the
     * splitting list an ordering, and take only the highest (~most
     * informative/reliable) sister annotation.
