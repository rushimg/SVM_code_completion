/**
 * Binarizes trees in such a way that head-argument structure is respected.
 * Looks only at the value of input tree nodes.
 * Produces LSTrees with CWT labels.  The input trees have to have CWT labels!
 * Although the binarizer always respects heads, you can get left or right
 * binarization by defining an appropriate HeadFinder.
