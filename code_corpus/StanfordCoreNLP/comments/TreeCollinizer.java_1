/**
 * Does detransformations to a parsed sentence to map it back to the
 * standard treebank form for output or evaluation.
 * This version has Penn-Treebank-English-specific details, but can probably
 * be used without harm on other treebanks.
 * Returns labels to their basic category, removes punctuation (should be with
 * respect to a gold tree, but currently isn't), deletes the boundary symbol,
 * changes PRT labels to ADVP.
