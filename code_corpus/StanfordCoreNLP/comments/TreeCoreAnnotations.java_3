   * The CoreMap key for getting the binarized version of the

   * This key is typically set on sentence annotations.  It is only
   * set if the parser annotator was specifically set to parse with
   * this (parse.saveBinarized).  The sentiment annotator requires
   * this kind of tree, but otherwise it is not typically used.
