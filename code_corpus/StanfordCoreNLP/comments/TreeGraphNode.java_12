   * Implements equality for <code>TreeGraphNode</code>s.  Unlike
   * <code>Tree</code>s, <code>TreeGraphNode</code>s should be
   * considered equal only if they are ==.  <i>Implementation note:</i>
   * TODO: This should be changed via introducing a Tree interface with the current Tree and this class implementing it, since what is done here breaks the equals() contract.
   *
   * @param o The object to compare with
   * @return Whether two things are equal
