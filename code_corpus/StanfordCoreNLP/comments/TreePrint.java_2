  /** Pool use of one WordNetConnection.  I don't really know if
   *  Dan Bikel's WordNet code is thread safe, but it definitely doesn't
   *  close its files, and too much of our code makes TreePrint objects and
   *  then drops them on the floor, and so we run out of file handles.
   *  That is, if this variable isn't static, code crashes.
   *  Maybe we should change this code to use jwnl(x)?
