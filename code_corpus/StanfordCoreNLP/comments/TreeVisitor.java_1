/**
 * This is a simple strategy-type interface for operations that are applied to
 * <code>Tree</code>. It typically is called iteratively over
 * trees in a <code>Treebank</code>.  The convention is for <code>TreeVisitor</code> implementing
 * classes not to affect <code>Tree</code> instances they operate on, but to accomplish things via
 * side effects (like counting statistics over trees, etc.).
