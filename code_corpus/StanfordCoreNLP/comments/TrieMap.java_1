/**
 * Map that takes a iterable as key, and maps it to an value.

 * This implementation is not particularly memory efficient, but will have relatively
 * fast lookup times for sequences where there are many possible keys (e.g. sequences over Strings).
 * Can be used for fairly efficient look up of sequence by prefix.
