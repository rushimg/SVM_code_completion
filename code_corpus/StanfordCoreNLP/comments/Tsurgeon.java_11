  /**
   * Collects a list of operation patterns into a sequence of operations to be applied.  Required to keep track of global properties
   * across a sequence of operations.  For example, if you want to insert a named node and then coindex it with another node,
   * you will need to collect the insertion and coindexation operations into a single TsurgeonPattern so that tsurgeon is aware
   * of the name of the new node and coindexation becomes possible.
   * @param patterns a list of {@link TsurgeonPattern} operations that you want to collect together into a single compound operation
   * @return a new {@link TsurgeonPattern} that performs all the operations in the sequence of the <code>patterns</code> argument
