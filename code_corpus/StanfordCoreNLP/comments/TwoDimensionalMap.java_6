  /**
   * Internal class which represents an iterator over the data in the
   * TwoDimensionalMap.  It keeps state in the form of an iterator
   * over the outer map, which maps keys to inner maps, and an
   * iterator over the most recent inner map seen.  When the inner map
   * has been completely iterated over, the outer map iterator
   * advances one step.  The iterator is finished when all key pairs
   * have been returned once.
