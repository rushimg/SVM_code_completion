/** Provides a Unicode-aware plain whitespace tokenizer.  This tokenizer separates words
 *  based on whitespace, including Unicode spaces such as the CJK ideographic space as well
 *  as traditional Unix whitespace characters.  It can optionally separate out and return
 *  newline characters, again recognizing all Unicode newline sequences.
 *  Designed to be called by <code>WhitespaceTokenizer</code>.
