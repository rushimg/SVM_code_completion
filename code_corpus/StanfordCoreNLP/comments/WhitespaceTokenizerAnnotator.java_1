/**
 * This annotator uses a WhitespaceTokenizer to split TextAnnotations

 * If either the property EOL_PROPERTY or the property
 * NEWLINE_SPLITTER_PROPERTY defined in StanfordCoreNLP are present
 * and set to true, newlines are returned as tokens.  In practice,
 * either will mean the newlines get removed by the sentence splitter.
