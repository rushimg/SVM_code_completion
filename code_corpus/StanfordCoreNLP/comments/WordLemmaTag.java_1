/**
 * A WordLemmaTag corresponds to a pair of a tagged (e.g., for part of speech)
 * word and its lemma. WordLemmaTag is implemented with String-valued word,
 * lemma and tag.
 * It implements the Label interface; the <code>value()</code> method for that
 * interface corresponds to the word of the WordLemmaTag.
 * <p/>
 * The equality relation for WordLemmaTag is defined as identity of
 * word, lemma and tag.
