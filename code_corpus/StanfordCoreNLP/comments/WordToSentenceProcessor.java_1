/**
 * Transforms a List of words into a List of Lists of words (that is, a List
 * of sentences), by grouping the words.  The word stream is assumed to
 * already be adequately tokenized, and this class just divides the List into
 * sentences, perhaps discarding some separator tokens as it goes.
 * <p>
 * The main behavior is to look for sentence ending tokens like "." or "?!?",
 * and to split after them and any following sentence closers like ")".
 * Overlaid on this is an overall choice of state: The WordToSentenceProcessor
 * can be a non-splitter, which always returns one sentence. Otherwise, the
 * WordToSentenceProcessor will also split based on paragraphs using one of
 * these three states: (1) Ignore line breaks in splitting sentences,
 * (2) Treat each line as a separate paragraph, or (3) Treat two consecutive
 * line breaks as marking the end of a paragraph. The details of sentence
 * breaking within paragraphs is controlled based on the following three
 * variables:
 * <ul>
 * <li>sentenceBoundaryTokens are tokens that are left in a sentence, but are
 * to be regarded as ending a sentence.  A canonical example is a period.
 * If two of these follow each other, the second will be a sentence
 * consisting of only the sentenceBoundaryToken.
 * <li>sentenceBoundaryFollowers are tokens that are left in a sentence, and
 * which can follow a sentenceBoundaryToken while still belonging to
 * the previous sentence.  They cannot begin a sentence (except at the
 * beginning of a document).  A canonical example is a close parenthesis
 * ')'.
 * <li>sentenceBoundaryToDiscard are tokens which separate sentences and
 * which should be thrown away.  In web documents, a typical example would
 * be a '{@code <p>}' tag.  If two of these follow each other, they are
 * coalesced: no empty Sentence is output.  The end-of-file is not
 * represented in this Set, but the code behaves as if it were a member.
 * <li>regionElementRegex A regular expression for element names containing
 * a sentence region. Only tokens in such elements will be included in
 * sentences. The start and end tags themselves are not included in the
 * sentence.
 * </ul>
