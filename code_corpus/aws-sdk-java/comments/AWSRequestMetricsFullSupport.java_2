/**
 * In contrast to {@link AWSRequestMetrics}, which is intended to be a minimal
 * support of AWS SDK request metrics, this class is the full support of AWS SDK
 * request metrics including features such as properties and sub-events.
 * <p>
 * This class is instantiated instead of {@link AWSRequestMetrics} when request
 * metric collection is required during a particular service request/response
 * cycle.
