/**
 * Client for accessing AWSSecurityTokenService.  All service calls made
 * using this client are blocking, and will not return until the service call
 * completes.
 * <p>
 * AWS Security Token Service <p>
 * The AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and
 * Access Management (AWS IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the AWS STS API. For more
 * detailed information about using this service, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UsingSTS/Welcome.html"> Using Temporary Security
 * Credentials </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
 * languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS STS. For
 * example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS
 * SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page.
