/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AmazonAutoScaling.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * Auto Scaling <p>
 * Auto Scaling is a web service designed to automatically launch or terminate Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances based on user-defined
 * policies, schedules, and health checks. This service is used in conjunction with Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Auto Scaling provides APIs that you can call by submitting a Query Request. Query requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verbs GET or
 * POST and a Query parameter named <i>Action</i> or <i>Operation</i> that specifies the API you are calling. Action is used throughout this
 * documentation, although Operation is also supported for backward compatibility with other Amazon Web Services (AWS) Query APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Calling the API using a Query request is the most direct way to access the web service, but requires that your application handle low-level details
 * such as generating the hash to sign the request and error handling. The benefit of calling the service using a Query request is that you are assured
 * of having access to the complete functionality of the API. For information about signing a a query request, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/api_requests.html"> Use Query Requests to Call Auto Scaling APIs </a>
 * </p>

 * This guide provides detailed information about Auto Scaling actions, data types, parameters, and errors. For detailed information about Auto Scaling
 * features and their associated API actions, go to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/"> Auto Scaling Developer
 * Guide </a> .

 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The examples in this guide assume that your instances are launched in the US East (Northern Virginia) region and use us-east-1 as the endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can set up your Auto Scaling infrastructure in other AWS regions. For information about this product's regions and endpoints, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html"> Regions and Endpoints </a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
