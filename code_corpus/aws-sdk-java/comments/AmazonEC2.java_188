    /**
     * <p>
     * Gives you information about your customer gateways. You can filter
     * the results to return information only about customer gateways that
     * match criteria you specify. For example, you could ask to get
     * information about a particular customer gateway (or all) only if the
     * gateway's state is pending or available. You can specify multiple
     * filters (e.g., the customer gateway has a particular IP address for
     * the Internet-routable external interface, and the gateway's state is
     * pending or available). The result includes information for a
     * particular customer gateway only if the gateway matches all your
     * filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned; the
     * response is simply empty. The following table shows the available
     * filters.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @return The response from the DescribeCustomerGateways service method,
     *         as returned by AmazonEC2.
     * 
     *
     * @throws AmazonClientException
     *             If any internal errors are encountered inside the client while
     *             attempting to make the request or handle the response.  For example
     *             if a network connection is not available.
     * @throws AmazonServiceException
     *             If an error response is returned by AmazonEC2 indicating
     *             either a problem with the data in the request, or a server side issue.
