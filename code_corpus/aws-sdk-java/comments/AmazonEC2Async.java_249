     * <p>
     * After you perform this action, the subnet no longer uses the routes
     * in the route table. Instead it uses the routes in the VPC's main route
     * table. For more information about route tables, go to <a

     *             If any internal errors are encountered inside the client while
     *             attempting to make the request or handle the response.  For example
     *             if a network connection is not available.
     * @throws AmazonServiceException
     *             If an error response is returned by AmazonEC2 indicating
     *             either a problem with the data in the request, or a server side issue.
