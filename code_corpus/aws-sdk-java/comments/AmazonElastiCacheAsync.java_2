/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonElastiCache asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon ElastiCache <p>
 * Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With ElastiCache, customers gain all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with far less of the administrative burden of launching
 * and managing a distributed cache. The service makes set-up, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache
 * deployment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their
 * cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.
 * </p>
