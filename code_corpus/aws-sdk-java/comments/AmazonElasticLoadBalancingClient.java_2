 * Client for accessing AmazonElasticLoadBalancing.  All service calls made

 * <p>
 * Elastic Load Balancing <p>
 * Elastic Load Balancing is a cost-effective and easy to use web service to help you improve the availability and scalability of your application
 * running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2). It makes it easy for you to distribute application loads between two or more EC2 instances.
 * Elastic Load Balancing supports the growth in traffic of your application by enabling availability through redundancy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This guide provides detailed information about Elastic Load Balancing actions, data types, and parameters that can be used for sending a query
 * request. Query requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a query parameter named Action or Operation. Action is used
 * throughout this documentation, although Operation is supported for backward compatibility with other AWS Query APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For detailed information on constructing a query request using the actions, data types, and parameters mentioned in this guide, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-query-api.html"> Using the Query API </a> in the <i>Elastic Load
 * Balancing Developer Guide</i> .

 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The examples in this guide assume that your load balancers are created in the US East (Northern Virginia) region and use us-east-1 as the endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can create your load balancers in other AWS regions. For information about regions and endpoints supported by Elastic Load Balancing, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html"> Regions and Endpoints </a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
