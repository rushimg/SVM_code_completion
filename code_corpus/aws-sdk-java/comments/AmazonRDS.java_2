/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonRDS.
 * Amazon Relational Database Service <p>
 * Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the
 * cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks,
 * freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar MySQL or Oracle database server. This means the code, applications, and tools you
 * already use today with your existing MySQL or Oracle databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your
 * database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database instance's compute
 * resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only
 * for the resources you use.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is an interface reference for Amazon RDS. It contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon
 * RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine
 * when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance
 * reboot, or during the maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces"> Available RDS Interfaces </a> .
