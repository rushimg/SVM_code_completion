     * Creates a new DB parameter group.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A DB parameter group is initially created with the default parameters
     * for the database engine used by the DB instance. To provide custom
     * values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after
     * creating it using <i>ModifyDBParameterGroup</i> . Once you've created
     * a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance
     * using <i>ModifyDBInstance</i> . When you associate a new DB parameter
     * group with a running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB Instance
     * for the new DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param createDBParameterGroupRequest Container for the necessary
     *           parameters to execute the CreateDBParameterGroup operation on
     *           AmazonRDS.
     * 
     * @return A Java Future object containing the response from the
     *         CreateDBParameterGroup service method, as returned by AmazonRDS.
     * 
     *
     * @throws AmazonClientException
     *             If any internal errors are encountered inside the client while
     *             attempting to make the request or handle the response.  For example
     *             if a network connection is not available.
     * @throws AmazonServiceException
     *             If an error response is returned by AmazonRDS indicating
     *             either a problem with the data in the request, or a server side issue.
