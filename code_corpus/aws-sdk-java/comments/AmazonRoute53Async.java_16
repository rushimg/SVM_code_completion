    /**
     * <p>
     * This action deletes a health check. To delete a health check, send a
     * <code>DELETE</code> request to the <code>2012-12-12/healthcheck/health
     * check ID </code> resource.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> You can delete a health check only if there are no
     * resource record sets associated with this health check. If resource
     * record sets are associated with this health check, you must
     * disassociate them before you can delete your health check. If you try
     * to delete a health check that is associated with resource record sets,
     * Route 53 will deny your request with a HealthCheckInUse error. For
     * information about disassociating the records from your health check,
     * see ChangeResourceRecordSets.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param deleteHealthCheckRequest Container for the necessary parameters
     *           to execute the DeleteHealthCheck operation on AmazonRoute53.
     * @param asyncHandler Asynchronous callback handler for events in the
     *           life-cycle of the request. Users could provide the implementation of
     *           the four callback methods in this interface to process the operation
     *           result or handle the exception.
     * 
     * @return A Java Future object containing the response from the
     *         DeleteHealthCheck service method, as returned by AmazonRoute53.
     * 
     *
     * @throws AmazonClientException
     *             If any internal errors are encountered inside the client while
     *             attempting to make the request or handle the response.  For example
     *             if a network connection is not available.
     * @throws AmazonServiceException
     *             If an error response is returned by AmazonRoute53 indicating
     *             either a problem with the data in the request, or a server side issue.
