     *             If any internal errors are encountered inside the client while
     *             attempting to make the request or handle the response.  For example
     *             if a network connection is not available.

     *             If an error response is returned by AmazonSimpleDB indicating
     *             either a problem with the data in the request, or a server side issue.
