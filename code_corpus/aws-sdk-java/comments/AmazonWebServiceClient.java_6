     * Overrides the default endpoint for this client. Callers can use this
     * method to control which AWS region they want to work with.
     * <p>
     * <b>This method is not threadsafe. Endpoints should be configured when the
     * client is created and before any service requests are made. Changing it
     * afterwards creates inevitable race conditions for any service requests in
     * transit.</b>
     * <p>
     * Callers can pass in just the endpoint (ex: "ec2.amazonaws.com") or a full
     * URL, including the protocol (ex: "https://ec2.amazonaws.com"). If the
     * protocol is not specified here, the default protocol from this client's
     * {@link ClientConfiguration} will be used, which by default is HTTPS.
