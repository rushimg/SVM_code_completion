/**
 * A hook allowing a custom transform/untransform of the raw attribute
 * values immediately before writing them into DynamoDB and immediately
 * after reading them out of DynamoDB, but with extra context about
 * the model class not available at the raw AmazonDymnamoDB level.
 * <p>
 * This interface contains both a {@code transform} method and a corresponding
 * {@code untransform} method. These methods SHOULD be inverses, such that
 * untransform(transform(value)) == value.
