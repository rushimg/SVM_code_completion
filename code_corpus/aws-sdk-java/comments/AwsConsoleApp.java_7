         * The AWS SimpleDB client allows you to query and manage your data
         * stored in SimpleDB domains (similar to tables in a relational DB).
         *
         * In this sample, we use a SimpleDB client to iterate over all the
         * domains owned by the current user, and add up the number of items
         * (similar to rows of data in a relational DB) in each domain.
