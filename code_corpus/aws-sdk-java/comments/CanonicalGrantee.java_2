/**
 * Represents a grantee identified by their canonical Amazon ID.
 * The canonical Amazon ID can be thought of as
 * an Amazon-internal ID specific to a user. For
 * example, Amazon can map a grantee identified by an email address to a
 * canonical ID.
 * <p>
 * Canonical grantees may have an associated display name, which is a
 * human-friendly name that Amazon has linked to the canonical ID (eg. the user's
 * login name).
