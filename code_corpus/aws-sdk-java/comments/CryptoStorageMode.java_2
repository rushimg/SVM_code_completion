/**
 * Denotes the different storage modes available for storing the encryption
 * information that accompanies encrypted objects in S3. The encryption
 * information includes an encrypted envelope symmetric key, an initialization
 * vector, and a description of the encryption materials used during encryption.
 * <p>
 * ObjectMetadata is the default storage mode. If the ObjectMetadata mode is
 * used, then encryption information will be placed in the metadata of the
 * encrypted object stored in S3. Note: There is a 2 KB limit on the size of the
 * metadata, so be careful that you do not run out of space if you are storing a
 * lot of your own metadata.
 * <p>
 * If the InstructionFile mode is used, then encryption information will be
 * placed in a separate instruction file that will be stored in the same bucket
 * as the encrypted object in S3. No metadata will be used for storing
 * encryption information.
