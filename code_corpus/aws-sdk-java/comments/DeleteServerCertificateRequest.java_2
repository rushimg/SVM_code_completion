/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.identitymanagement.AmazonIdentityManagement#deleteServerCertificate(DeleteServerCertificateRequest) DeleteServerCertificate operation}.
 * <p>
 * Deletes the specified server certificate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your
 * application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause
 * Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before
 * using this command to delete the certificate. For more information, go to DeleteLoadBalancerListeners in the Elastic Load Balancing API Reference.
