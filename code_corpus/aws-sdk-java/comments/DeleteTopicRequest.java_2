/**

 * <p>
 * The <code>DeleteTopic</code> action deletes a topic and all its subscriptions. Deleting a topic might prevent some messages previously sent to the
 * topic from being delivered to subscribers. This action is idempotent, so deleting a topic that does not exist does not result in an error.
