/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.storagegateway.AWSStorageGateway#describeBandwidthRateLimit(DescribeBandwidthRateLimitRequest) DescribeBandwidthRateLimit operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation returns the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. By default, these limits are not set, which means no bandwidth rate limiting is in
 * effect.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation only returns a value for a bandwidth rate limit only if the limit is set. If no limits are set for the gateway, then this operation
 * returns only the gateway ARN in the response body. To specify which gateway to describe, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your
 * request.
