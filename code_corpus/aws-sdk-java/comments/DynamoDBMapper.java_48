     * Queries an Amazon DynamoDB table and returns a single page of matching
     * results. The table to query is determined by looking at the annotations
     * on the specified class, which declares where to store the object data in
     * Amazon DynamoDB, and the query expression parameter allows the caller to
     * filter results and control how the query is executed.
