    /**
     * A transformation expects to see all values, including keys, when
     * determining the transformation, therefore we must insert them if they are
     * not already present. However, we must remove the keys prior to actual
     * storage as this method is called when updating DynamoDB, which does
     * not permit the modification of key attributes as part of an update call.
