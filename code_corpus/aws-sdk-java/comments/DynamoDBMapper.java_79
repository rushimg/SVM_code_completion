    /**
     * Scans through an Amazon DynamoDB table and returns the matching results as
     * an unmodifiable list of instantiated objects. The table to scan is
     * determined by looking at the annotations on the specified class, which
     * declares where to store the object data in Amazon DynamoDB, and the scan
     * expression parameter allows the caller to filter results and control how
     * the scan is executed.
     * <p>
     * Callers should be aware that the returned list is unmodifiable, and any
     * attempts to modify the list will result in an
     * UnsupportedOperationException.
     * <p>
     * You can specify the pagination loading strategy for this scan operation.
     * By default, the list returned is lazily loaded when possible.
     *
     * @param <T>
     *            The type of the objects being returned.
     * @param clazz
     *            The class annotated with DynamoDB annotations describing how
     *            to store the object data in Amazon DynamoDB.
     * @param scanExpression
     *            Details on how to run the scan, including any filters to apply
     *            to limit results.
     * @param config
     *            The configuration to use for this scan, which overrides the
     *            default provided at object construction.
     * @return An unmodifiable list of the objects constructed from the results
     *         of the scan operation.
