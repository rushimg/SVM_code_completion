     * Enumeration of consistent read behavior.
     * <p>
     * CONSISTENT uses consistent reads, EVENTUAL does not. Consistent reads
     * have implications for performance and billing; see the service
     * documentation for details.
     * <p>
     * By default, the mapper uses eventual consistency.
