/**
 * Annotation for marking a property as an optimistic locking version attribute.
 * Applied to the getter method for the class's version property.
 * <p>
 * Only nullable, integral numeric types (e.g. Integer, Long) can be used as
 * version properties. On a save() operation, the {@link DynamoDBMapper} will
 * attempt to increment the version property and assert that the service's value
 * matches the client's. New objects will be assigned a version of 1 when saved.
