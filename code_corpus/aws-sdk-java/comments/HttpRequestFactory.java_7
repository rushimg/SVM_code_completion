         * Apache HttpClient omits the port number in the Host header (even if
         * we explicitly specify it) if it's the default port for the protocol

         * in the calculated string to sign (even if Apache HttpClient changed
         * and started honoring our explicit host with endpoint), we follow this
         * same behavior here and in the QueryString signer.
