/**
 * This class combines the handler we are supposed to call after the request is
 * completed and the original request object. The reason to hold on to the
 * original request is that we have to provide it to the async handler on
 * successful completion. Storing the request object here means we don't have to
 * store it in the classes that do actual work. Those classes tend to forget
 * about the request objects as soon as the required data was extracted from
 * them.
