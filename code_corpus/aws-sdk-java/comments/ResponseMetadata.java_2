/**
 * Represents additional metadata included with a response from AWS. Response
 * metadata varies by service, but all services return an AWS request ID that
 * can be used in the event a service call isn't working as expected and you
 * need to work with AWS support to debug an issue.
 * <p>
 * Access to AWS request IDs is also available through the com.amazonaws.request
 * logger in the AWS SDK for Java.
