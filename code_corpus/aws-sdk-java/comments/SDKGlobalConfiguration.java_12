     * globalTimeOffset is a time offset that is used to globally adjust the
     * client clock skew. Java SDK already provides timeOffset and accessor methods
     * in {@link Request} class but those are used per request, whereas
     * this variable will adjust clock skew globally. Java SDK detects clock
     * skew errors and adjusts global clock skew automatically.
