/**
 * Manages an upload by periodically checking to see if the upload is done, and
 * returning a result if so. Otherwise, schedules a copy of itself to be run in
 * the future and returns null. When waiting on the result of this class via a
 * Future object, clients must call {@link UploadMonitor#isDone()} and
 * {@link UploadMonitor#getFuture()}
