/**
 * {@link Beta} <br/>
 * Customizes the behavior of a JSON parser.
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods have a default trivial implementation, so subclasses need only implement the methods
 * whose behavior needs customization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementation has no fields and therefore thread-safe, but sub-classes are not necessarily
 * thread-safe.
