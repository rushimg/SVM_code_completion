         * Strategy: The root is the middlemost element. To get to it, we
         * have to first recursively construct the entire left subtree,
         * so as to grab all of its elements. We can then proceed with right
         * subtree.
         *
         * The lo and hi arguments are the minimum and maximum
         * indices to pull out of the iterator or stream for current subtree.
         * They are not actually indexed, we just proceed sequentially,
         * ensuring that items are extracted in corresponding order.
