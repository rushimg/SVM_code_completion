         * Indicates the baseline remains fixed relative to the height

         * any height H the difference between H and
         * <code>getBaseline(w, H)</code> is the same.  For example, a
         * <code>JLabel</code> containing non-empty text with a
         * vertical alignment of <code>BOTTOM</code> should have a
         * baseline type of <code>CONSTANT_DESCENT</code>.
