/**
         * Endpoints are represented as triples (fromStart, lo,
         * loInclusive) and (toEnd, hi, hiInclusive). If fromStart is
         * true, then the low (absolute) bound is the start of the
         * backing map, and the other values are ignored. Otherwise,
         * if loInclusive is true, lo is the inclusive bound, else lo
         * is the exclusive bound. Similarly for the upper bound.
