/*
 * In a server it is very important to be able to operate on
 * the original byte[] without converting everything to chars.
 * Some protocols are ASCII only, and some allow different
 * non-UNICODE encodings. The encoding is not known beforehand,
 * and can even change during the execution of the protocol.
 * ( for example a multipart message may have parts with different
 *  encoding )
 *
 * For HTTP it is not very clear how the encoding of RequestURI
 * and mime values can be determined, but it is a great advantage
 * to be able to parse the request without converting to string.
