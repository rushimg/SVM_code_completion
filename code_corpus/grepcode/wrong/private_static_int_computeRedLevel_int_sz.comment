/**
     * Find the level down to which to assign all nodes BLACK.  This is the
     * last `full' level of the complete binary tree produced by
     * buildTree. The remaining nodes are colored RED. (This makes a `nice'
     * set of color assignments wrt future insertions.) This level number is
     * computed by finding the number of splits needed to reach the zeroeth
     * node.  (The answer is ~lg(N), but in any case must be computed by same
     * quick O(lg(N)) loop.)
