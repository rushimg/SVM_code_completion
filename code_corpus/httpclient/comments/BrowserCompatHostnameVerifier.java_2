 * The hostname must match either the first CN, or any of the subject-alts.
 * A wildcard can occur in the CN, and in any of the subject-alts.
 * <p/>
 * The only difference between BROWSER_COMPATIBLE and STRICT is that a wildcard
 * (such as "*.foo.com") with BROWSER_COMPATIBLE matches all subdomains,
 * including "a.b.foo.com".
