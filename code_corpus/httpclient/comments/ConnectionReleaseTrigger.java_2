/**
 * Interface for releasing a connection. This can be implemented by various
 * "trigger" objects which are associated with a connection, for example
 * a {@link EofSensorInputStream stream} or an {@link BasicManagedEntity entity}
 * or the {@link ManagedClientConnection connection} itself.
 * <p>
 * The methods in this interface can safely be called multiple times.
 * The first invocation releases the connection, subsequent calls
 * are ignored.
