/**
 * A new path is created from a path concatenated to an edge. It's like a linked
 * list.<br>
 * The empty path is composed only of one vertex.<br>
 * In this case the path has no previous path element.<br>
 * .
 *
 * <p>NOTE jvs 1-Jan-2008: This is an internal data structure for use in
 * algorithms. For returning paths to callers, use the public {@link GraphPath}
 * interface instead.
