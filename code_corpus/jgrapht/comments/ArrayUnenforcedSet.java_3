/**
 * Helper for efficiently representing small sets whose elements are known to be
 * unique by construction, implying we don't need to enforce the uniqueness
 * property in the data structure itself. Use with caution.
 *
 * <p>Note that for equals/hashCode, the class implements the Set behavior
 * (unordered), not the list behavior (ordered); the fact that it subclasses
 * ArrayList should be considered an implementation detail.
