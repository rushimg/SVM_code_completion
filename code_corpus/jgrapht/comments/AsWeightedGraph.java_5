    /**
     * Constructor for AsWeightedGraph.
     *
     * @param g the backing graph over which a weighted view is to be created.
     * @param weightMap A mapping of edges to weights. If an edge is not present
     * in the weight map, the edge weight for the underlying graph is returned.
     * Note that a live reference to this map is retained, so if the caller
     * changes the map after construction, the changes will affect the
     * AsWeightedGraph instance as well.
