/**
 * Allows the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChromaticNumber.html">
 * chromatic number</a> of a graph to be calculated. This is the minimal number
 * of colors needed to color each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices
 * share the same color. This algorithm will not find the true chromatic number,
 * since this is an NP-complete problem. So, a greedy algorithm will find an
 * approximate chromatic number.
