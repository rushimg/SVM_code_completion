         * We want two iterators over the vertex set, one fast and one slow.
         * The slow one will move through the set once. For each vertex,
         * the fast iterator moves through the set, adding an edge to all
         * vertices we haven't connected to yet.
         *
         * If we have an undirected graph, the second addEdge call will return
         * nothing; it will not add a second edge.
