/**
 * This algorithm will check whether a graph is Eulerian (hence it contains an
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerianCircuit.html">Eulerian
 * circuit</a>). Also, if a graph is Eulerian, the caller can obtain a list of
 * vertices making up the Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit is a circuit
 * which traverses each edge exactly once.
