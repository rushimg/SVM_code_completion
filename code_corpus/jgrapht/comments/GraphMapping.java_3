/**
 * GraphMapping represents a bidirectional mapping between two graphs (called
 * graph1 and graph2), which allows the caller to obtain the matching vertex or
 * edge in either direction, from graph1 to graph2, or from graph2 to graph1. It
 * does not have to always be a complete bidirectional mapping (it could return
 * null for some lookups).
