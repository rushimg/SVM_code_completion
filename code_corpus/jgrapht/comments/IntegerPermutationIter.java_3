/**
 * Iterates through permutations of N elements.
 * <li>use getNext() to get the next permutation order, for example(N=4):
 * perm0=[1,2,3,4] perm1=[1,2,4,3] perm2=[1,3,2,4] .
 * <li>use hasNext() or verify by counter<getTotalNumberOfPermutations () that
 * you do not overflow the max number. RunTimeException will be thrown if you
 * do. Getting the next permutation is done in O(N) Note: This class is not
 * thread safe.
