/**
 * An unmodifiable subgraph induced by a vertex/edge masking function. The
 * subgraph will keep track of edges being added to its vertex subset as well as
 * deletion of edges and vertices. When iterating over the vertices/edges, it
 * will iterate over the vertices/edges of the base graph and discard
 * vertices/edges that are masked (an edge with a masked extremity vertex is
 * discarded as well).
