    TextNode is a node, and so by default comes with attributes and children. The attributes are seldom used, but use
    memory, and the child nodes are never used. So we don't have them, and override accessors to attributes to create
    them as needed on the fly.
    private static final String TEXT_KEY = "text";
    String text;
