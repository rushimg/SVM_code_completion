/**
 * Node visitor interface. Provide an implementing class to {@link NodeTraversor} to iterate through nodes.
 * <p/>
 * This interface provides two methods, {@code head} and {@code tail}. The head method is called when the node is first
 * seen, and the tail method when all of the node's children have been visited. As an example, head can be used to
 * create a start tag for a node, and tail to create the end tag.
