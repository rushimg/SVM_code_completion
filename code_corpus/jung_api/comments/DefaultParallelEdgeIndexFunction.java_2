/**
 * A class which creates and maintains indices for parallel edges.
 * Parallel edges are defined here to be the collection of edges 
 * that are returned by <code>v.findEdgeSet(w)</code> for some 
 * <code>v</code> and <code>w</code>.
 * 
 * <p>At this time, users are responsible for resetting the indices 
 * (by calling <code>reset()</code>) if changes to the
 * graph make it appropriate.</p>
