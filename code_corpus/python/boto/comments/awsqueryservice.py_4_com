        First checks to see if a url argument was explicitly passed
        in.  If so, that will be used.  If not, it checks for the
        existence of the environment variable specified in ENV_URL.
        If this is set, it should contain a fully qualified URL to the
        service you want to use.
        Note that any values passed explicitly to the class constructor
        will take precedence.
