        Create a new Hosted Zone.  Returns a Python data structure with
        information about the newly created Hosted Zone.
        :type domain_name: str
        :param domain_name: The name of the domain. This should be a
            fully-specified domain, and should end with a final period
            as the last label indication.  If you omit the final period,
            Amazon Route 53 assumes the domain is relative to the root.
            This is the name you have registered with your DNS registrar.
            It is also the name you will delegate from your registrar to
            the Amazon Route 53 delegation servers returned in
            response to this request.A list of strings with the image
            IDs wanted.
        :type caller_ref: str
        :param caller_ref: A unique string that identifies the request
            and that allows failed CreateHostedZone requests to be retried
            without the risk of executing the operation twice.  If you don't
            provide a value for this, boto will generate a Type 4 UUID and
            use that.
        :type comment: str
        :param comment: Any comments you want to include about the hosted
            zone.
