        Add tags to this object.  Tags are stored by AWS and can be used
        to organize and filter resources.  Adding tags involves a round-trip
        to the EC2 service.
        :type tags: dict
        :param tags: A dictionary of key-value pairs for the tags being stored.
                     If for some tags you want only the name and no value, the
                     corresponding value for that tag name should be an empty
                     string.
