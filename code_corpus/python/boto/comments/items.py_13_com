"""
        Returns whether or not the data has changed on the ``Item``.
        Optionally accepts a ``data`` argument, which accepts the output from
        ``self._determine_alterations()`` if you've already called it. Typically
        unnecessary to do. Default is ``None``.
        Example:
            >>> user.needs_save()
            False
            >>> user['first_name'] = 'Johann'
            >>> user.needs_save()
            True
