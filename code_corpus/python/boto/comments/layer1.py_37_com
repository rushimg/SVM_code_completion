"""
        Returns a list of the available reserved node offerings by
        Amazon Redshift with their descriptions including the node
        type, the fixed and recurring costs of reserving the node and
        duration the node will be reserved for you. These descriptions
        help you determine which reserve node offering you want to
        purchase. You then use the unique offering ID in you call to
        PurchaseReservedNodeOffering to reserve one or more nodes for
        your Amazon Redshift cluster.
        For more information about managing parameter groups, go to
        `Purchasing Reserved Nodes`_ in the Amazon Redshift Management
        Guide .
        :type reserved_node_offering_id: string
        :param reserved_node_offering_id: The unique identifier for the
            offering.
        :type max_records: integer
        :param max_records: The maximum number of records to include in the
            response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords`
            value, a marker is included in the response so that the remaining
            results may be retrieved.
        Default: `100`
        Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.
        :type marker: string
        :param marker: An optional marker returned by a previous
            DescribeReservedNodeOfferings request to indicate the first
            offering that the request will return.
        You can specify either a **Marker** parameter or a
            **ClusterIdentifier** parameter in a DescribeClusters request, but
            not both.
