        Upload another part of this MultiPart Upload.
        .. note::
            After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts,
            you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop
            getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
            either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the
            parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.
