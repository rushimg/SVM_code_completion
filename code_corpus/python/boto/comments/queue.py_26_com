        Deprecated.  This is the old 'count' method that actually counts
        the messages by reading them all.  This gives an accurate count but
        is very slow for queues with non-trivial number of messasges.
        Instead, use get_attribute('ApproximateNumberOfMessages') to take
        advantage of the new SQS capability.  This is retained only for
        the unit tests.
