        Trim the number of snapshots for this volume.  This method always
        keeps the oldest snapshot.  It then uses the parameters passed in
        to determine how many others should be kept.
        The algorithm is to keep all snapshots from the current day.  Then
        it will keep the first snapshot of the day for the previous seven days.
        Then, it will keep the first snapshot of the week for the previous
        four weeks.  After than, it will keep the first snapshot of the month
        for as many months as there are.
