         * The AWS S3 client allows you to manage buckets and programmatically
         * put and get objects to those buckets.
         *
         * In this sample, we use an S3 client to iterate over all the buckets
         * owned by the current user, and all the object metadata in each
         * bucket, to obtain a total object and space usage count. This is done
         * without ever actually downloading a single object -- the requests
         * work with object metadata only.
