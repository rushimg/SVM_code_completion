/**
 * {@link AWSCredentialsProvider} implementation that chains together multiple
 * credentials providers. When a caller requests credentials from this provider,
 * it calls all the providers in the chain, in the original order specified,
 * until one can provide credentials, and then returns those credentials. If all
 * of the credential providers in the chain have been called, and none of them
 * can provide credentials, then this class will throw an exception indicated
 * that no credentials are available.
