/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AWSSecurityTokenService.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.

 * The AWS Security Token Service is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the AWS Security Token Service API.
