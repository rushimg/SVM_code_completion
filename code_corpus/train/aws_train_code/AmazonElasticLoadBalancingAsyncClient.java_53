    /**
     * <p>
     * Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that
     * follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be
     * associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This policy is similar to the policy created by
     * CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy, except that the lifetime of the
     * special Elastic Load Balancing cookie follows the lifetime of the
     * application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration.
     * The LoadBalancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the
     * application response includes a new application cookie.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the
     * session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>NOTE:</b> An application client must receive and send two cookies:
     * the application-generated cookie and the special Elastic Load
     * Balancing cookie named AWSELB. This is the default behavior for many
     * common web browsers.
     * </p>

     * @param createAppCookieStickinessPolicyRequest Container for the
     *           necessary parameters to execute the CreateAppCookieStickinessPolicy
     *           operation on AmazonElasticLoadBalancing.
     * @param asyncHandler Asynchronous callback handler for events in the
     *           life-cycle of the request. Users could provide the implementation of
     *           the four callback methods in this interface to process the operation
     *           result or handle the exception.
     * 
     * @return A Java Future object containing the response from the
     *         CreateAppCookieStickinessPolicy service method, as returned by
     *         AmazonElasticLoadBalancing.
     *
     * @throws AmazonClientException
     *             If any internal errors are encountered inside the client while
     *             attempting to make the request or handle the response.  For example
     *             if a network connection is not available.
     * @throws AmazonServiceException
     *             If an error response is returned by AmazonElasticLoadBalancing indicating
     *             either a problem with the data in the request, or a server side issue.
