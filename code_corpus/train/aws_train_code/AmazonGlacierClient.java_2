 * Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for "cold data."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With
 * Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the
 * administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data
 * replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is
 * acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, go to <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/"> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.
 * </p>
