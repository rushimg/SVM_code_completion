    /**
     * <p>
     * Sends an email message, with header and content specified by the
     * client. The <code>SendRawEmail</code> action is useful for sending
     * multipart MIME emails. The raw text of the message must comply with
     * Internet email standards; otherwise, the message cannot be sent.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>If you have not yet requested production access to
     * Amazon SES, then you will only be able to send email to and from
     * verified email addresses and domains. For more information, go to the
     * Amazon SES Developer Guide.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The total size of the message cannot exceed 10 MB. This includes any
     * attachments that are part of the message.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Amazon SES has a limit on the total number of recipients per message:
     * The combined number of To:, CC: and BCC: email addresses cannot exceed
     * 50. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can
     * divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call
     * Amazon SES repeatedly to send the message to each group.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (To:,
     * CC: and BCC:) is counted against your <i>sending quota</i> - the
     * maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period. For
     * information about your sending quota, go to the "Managing Your Sending
     * Activity" section of the<a
     * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide">
     * Amazon SES Developer Guide </a> .

     * @param asyncHandler Asynchronous callback handler for events in the

     *           result or handle the exception.
