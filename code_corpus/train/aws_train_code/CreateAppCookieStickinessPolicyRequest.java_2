/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.elasticloadbalancing.AmazonElasticLoadBalancing#createAppCookieStickinessPolicy(CreateAppCookieStickinessPolicyRequest) CreateAppCookieStickinessPolicy operation}.
 * <p>
 * Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be associated only
 * with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This policy is similar to the policy created by CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy, except that the lifetime of the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie
 * follows the lifetime of the application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration. The LoadBalancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie
 * when the application response includes a new application cookie.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> An application client must receive and send two cookies: the application-generated cookie and the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie
 * named AWSELB. This is the default behavior for many common web browsers.
 * </p>
