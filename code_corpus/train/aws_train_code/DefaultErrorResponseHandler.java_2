/**
 * Implementation of HttpResponseHandler that handles only error responses from
 * Amazon Web Services. A list of unmarshallers is passed into the constructor,
 * and while handling a response, each unmarshaller is tried, in order, until
 * one is found that can successfully unmarshall the error response.  If no
 * unmarshaller is found that can unmarshall the error response, a generic
 * AmazonServiceException is created and populated with the AWS error response
 * information (error message, AWS error code, AWS request ID, etc).
