/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.sns.AmazonSNS#deleteTopic(DeleteTopicRequest) DeleteTopic operation}.
 * <p>
 * The DeleteTopic action deletes a topic and all its subscriptions. Deleting a topic might prevent some messages previously sent to the topic from being
 * delivered to subscribers. This action is idempotent, so deleting a topic that does not exist will not result in an error.
