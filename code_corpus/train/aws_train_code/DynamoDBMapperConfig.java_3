     * Enumeration of behaviors for the save operation.
     * <p>
     * UPDATE will not affect unmodeled attributes on a save operation. CLOBBER
     * will clear and replace all attributes, included unmodeled ones, (delete
     * and recreate) on save. Versioned field constraints will also be
     * disregarded.
     * <p>
     * By default, the mapper uses UPDATE.
