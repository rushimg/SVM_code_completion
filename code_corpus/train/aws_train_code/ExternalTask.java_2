/**
 * Used to bridge asynchronous execution to external asynchronous APIs or
 * events. {@link ExternalTask#doExecute(handle)} method is expected to initiate
 * call to an external API and return without blocking. Then completion or
 * failure of the external task is reported through
 * {@link ExternalTaskCompletionHandle}. A cancellation handler returned by the
 * doExecute is used to report cancellation of the external task.
