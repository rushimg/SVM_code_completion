     * The Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or a
     * vault inventory. For archive data, the Content-Type is
     * application/octet-stream. For vault inventory, if you requested CSV
     * format when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is text/csv.
     * Otherwise, by default, vault inventory is returned as JSON, and the
     * Content-Type is application/json.
