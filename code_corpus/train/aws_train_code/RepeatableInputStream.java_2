/**
 * A repeatable input stream wrapper for any input stream. This input stream
 * relies on buffered data to repeat, and can therefore only be repeated when
 * less data has been read than this buffer can hold.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Always use a {@link RepeatableFileInputStream} instead of this
 * class if you are sourcing data from a file, as the file-based repeatable
 * input stream can be repeated without any limitations.
