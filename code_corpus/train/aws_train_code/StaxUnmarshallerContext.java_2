/**
 * Contains the unmarshalling state for the parsing of an XML response. The
 * unmarshallers are stateless so that they can be reused, so this class holds
 * the state while different unmarshallers work together to parse an XML
 * response. It also tracks the current position and element depth of the
 * document being parsed and provides utilties for accessing the next XML event
 * from the parser, reading element text, handling attribute XML events, etc.
