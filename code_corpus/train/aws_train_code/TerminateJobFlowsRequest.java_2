/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.elasticmapreduce.AmazonElasticMapReduce#terminateJobFlows(TerminateJobFlowsRequest) TerminateJobFlows operation}.
 * <p>
 * TerminateJobFlows shuts a list of job flows down. When a job flow is shut down, any step not yet completed is canceled and the EC2 instances on which
 * the job flow is running are stopped. Any log files not already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3 if a LogUri was specified when the job flow was
 * created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The call to TerminateJobFlows is asynchronous. Depending on the configuration of the job flow, it may take up to 5-20 minutes for the job flow to
 * completely terminate and release allocated resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.
 * </p>
 *
