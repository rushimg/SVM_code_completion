"13598101","Thank you! The .children() method is enough for me to write a BFS iterator on it, but for future reference, why is I jgrapht's not compatible? I read you used that library to build your tree structure so I thought it should be!

Last thing I need is to get the word labeled by the POS tag - say I have t = (PRP he). With t.label().value() I can get PRP, how do I get ""he"" ?

Thank you again! =)"

(While it has been retrofitted in various ways, such as implementing Iterable, the Tree class was originally written against JDK 1.1, before jgrapht existed, and in some ways shows its age....) We did previously use jgrapht behind our dependency graphs, but have recently moved away from it. Our impression was that many people preferred less library dependencies.
