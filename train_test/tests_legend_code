File to store which files correspond to which tests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: all tests below are run using tfidf of words in the code rather than the comments as the features

11 [1]) 5 train(1 correct) / 4 test(1 correct)	75% Accuracy[everything as -1]

12 [3]) 20 train(10 correct) / 20 test(10 correct)	Accuracy(50%)  files from one class correct,not from that class incorrect 

13 [4]) 10 train(3 correct) / 10 test (3 correct)	PR(100%/66.7%) specific all files within same class, correct methods are all constructors

14 [7]) 40 train/test (20 correct)	PR(52.38%/100%)

15 [10])47 train/test each (12 correct) PR(100%/36.36%) Distinguish JSONObject files from ther JSON files, not terrrible
